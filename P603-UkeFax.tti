OL,4,  What do you need to know before you   
OL,5,  even get into a shop?                 
OL,7,  What size?                            
OL,8, FSoprano: Easy to carry, good for      
OL,9, Fsmall children. Lower string tension. 
OL,10, FConcert: Slightly bigger, good for fat
OL,11, Ffingers. More frets. Less likely to   
OL,12, Fpull out of tune. Some people think   
OL,13, Fthat it has a fuller sound.           
OL,16,  Solid wood, laminate or plastic?      
OL,17, FSolid wood is the most expensive and  
OL,18, Fhas the best sound. Laminate has      
OL,19, Fbetter stability. While plastic is    
OL,20, Fcheap it will have accurate geometry  
OL,21, Fand as a bonus it is waterproof.

OL,4,  How do you know if you are holding a  
OL,5,  decent instrument or a piece of junk? 
OL,7,F Is the ukulele set up correctly? The  
OL,8,F neck should be flat. There should be  
OL,9,F no warp or curve to it. The strings   
OL,10,F should be close over the frets so you 
OL,11,F can press them easily but not so close
OL,12,F that notes buzz.                      
OL,14,F Try playing the open strings then bend
OL,15,F the neck up and down. If tunings go up
OL,16,F and down at the same time then there  
OL,17,F may be a problem.                     
OL,18,F G                                     
OL,19,F Beware of cracks and splits especially
OL,20,F on the neck joint and the bridge.     
OL,21,F A geared machine head will keep tune  
OL,22,F better than friction pegs.G       3/5

OL,1,MD]CChoosing a Ukulele                  
OL,4,  The strings go between the nut at the 
OL,5,  top and the bridge at the body. They  
OL,6,  hold the strings at the ideal height  
OL,7,  above the fretboard.                  
OL,9, FThe nut should hold the strings very  
OL,10, Fclose to the top fret, but not so low 
OL,11,F that it buzzes.                       
OL,12,F As you go down the fretboard the      
OL,13,F strings are given more of a gap to    
OL,14,F allow space for vibration. The part of
OL,15,F the bridge that touches the string is 
OL,16,F called the saddle.                    
OL,17,F The saddle and bridge should be firmly
OL,18,F fixed and the right height.           
OL,19, FToo low and you will get buzzing on   
OL,20,F the frets. Too high and you will find 
OL,21,F it difficult to hold down high chords.

OL,4,  If you have money to spare then what  
OL,5,  luxuries could you get?               
OL,7,F Electro-acoustic lets you play with   
OL,8, Famplification. Sometimes they also

OL,11, FA solid wood top will give a better
