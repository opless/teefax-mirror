OL,6, criticised the UK's pandemic planning  
OL,7, ahead of Covid, saying it was too      
OL,8, focused on dealing with deaths rather  
OL,9, than averting them.                    
OL,11,FHe told the Covid inquiry the focus was
OL,12,Fto plan for the consequences of a      
OL,13,Fdisaster: "Can we buy enough body bags,
OL,14,Fwhere are we going to bury the dead?   
OL,15,FThat was completely wrong."
