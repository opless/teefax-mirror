OL,5, The UK is set to enter recession this  
OL,6, year but it will be shorter and less   
OL,7, severe than previously thought,        
OL,8, according to the Bank of England.      
OL,10,FThe slump is now expected to last just 
OL,11,Fover a year rather than almost two as  
OL,12,Fenergy bills fall and price rises slow.
OL,14,FAs a result fewer people are likely to 
OL,15,Flose their jobs, but the economy       
OL,16,Fremains fragile, warned the Bank.      
OL,18,FThe forecast comes as interest rates   
OL,19,Fwere raised to 4% from 3.5%, their     
OL,20,Fhighest level in over 14 years.
