OL,5, The UK is set to enter recession this  
OL,6, year but it will be shorter and less   
OL,7, severe than previously thought,        
OL,8, according to the Bank of England.      
OL,10,FThe slump is now expected to last just 
OL,11,Fover a year rather than almost two as  
OL,12,Fenergy bills fall and price rises slow.
OL,14,FAs a result, fewer people are likely to
OL,15,Flose their jobs, but the number of job 
OL,16,Fvacancies - currently close to record  
OL,17,Flevels - are expected to fall.         
OL,19,FThe fresh forecast came as the Bank    
OL,20,Fraised interest rates to 4% from 3.5%.
