OL,5, Scotland's vaccine passport system will
OL,6, not be extended to more venues, Nicola 
OL,7, Sturgeon has announced.                
OL,9,FThe first minister had been considering
OL,10,Fexpanding the scheme to cover cinemas, 
OL,11,Ftheatres and other hospitality venues. 
OL,13,FBut she told MSPs that it would not be 
OL,14,Fproportionate to do so, with case      
OL,15,Fnumbers having fallen slightly.        
OL,17,FPeople will be allowed to present a    
OL,18,Fnegative test rather than proof of two 
OL,19,Fjabs to enter venues that are already
