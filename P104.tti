OL,5, Eight-year-old Aditi Shankar has become
OL,6, the first child in the UK to receive a 
OL,7, special type of kidney transplant that 
OL,8, does not require her to take long-term 
OL,9, drugs to stop rejection of the organ.  
OL,11,FDoctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital
OL,12,Fsay the breakthrough was made possible 
OL,13,Fby reprogramming her immune system     
OL,14,Fbefore giving her the new kidney.      
OL,16,FTo do that, they used bone-marrow stem 
OL,17,Fcells from the donor - Aditi's mother.
