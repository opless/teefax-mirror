OL,5, Prince Andrew is to face a civil case  
OL,6, in the US over allegations he sexually 
OL,7, assaulted a woman when she was 17.     
OL,9,FVirginia Giuffre is suing the prince,  
OL,10,Fclaiming he abused her in 2001.        
OL,12,FHis lawyers said the case should be    
OL,13,Fthrown out, citing a 2009 deal she     
OL,14,Fsigned with convicted sex offender     
OL,15,FJeffrey Epstein. But a New York judge  
OL,16,Fruled that the case could be heard.    
OL,18,FThe prince has consistently denied the 
OL,19,Fclaims. Buckingham Palace said it would
OL,20,Fnot comment on an ongoing legal matter.
