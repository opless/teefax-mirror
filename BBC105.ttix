OL,4,CMalaria 'completely stopped' by microbe
OL,5, Scientists have discovered a microbe
OL,6, that completely protects mosquitoes
OL,7, from being infected with malaria. 
OL,9,FThe team in Kenya and the UK say the
OL,10,Ffinding has "enormous potential" to
OL,11,Fcontrol the disease.
OL,13,FMalaria is spread by the bite of
OL,14,Finfected mosquitoes, so protecting them
OL,15,Fcould in turn protect people. 
OL,17,FThe researchers are now investigating
OL,18,Fwhether they can release infected
OL,19,Fmosquitoes into the wild, or use spores
OL,20,Fto suppress the disease.
