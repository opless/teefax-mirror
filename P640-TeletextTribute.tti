OL,1,M]DA note about this page...      0/16  
OL,4,CWhen CEEFAX closed down on 23rd October
OL,5,C2012, I put together a special tribute 
OL,6,Cfor my YouTube channel.                
OL,8, This was a blog of my own memories of  
OL,9, the service, presented as a series of  
OL,10, teletext pages with music, in the style
OL,11, of the "Pages from Ceefax" in-vision.  
OL,13, The pages were originally created in a 
OL,14, demo version of the Cebra editor, and a
OL,15, BBC Micro emulator was used to create  
OL,16, an authentic-looking teletext display. 
OL,18, I have converted the original "pages"  
OL,19, to the TTI format used by Teefax/VBitPi
OL,21, The original video can still be seen at
OL,22,         Fyoutu.be/vqwL4XtDLyg

OL,7,Gresearch department.                   
OL,9,CAs with many great inventions, it came

OL,11,Cinto methods to transmit subtitles for

OL,14,GThe R&D people realised that there were

OL,16,Gpicture which were not shown on screen 
OL,17,Gand could therefore be used to encode  
OL,18,Gdigital data.

OL,5,   D]GRob  \In the 90s, a huge number of
OL,6,    satellite channels appeared, most of
OL,7,    which carried their own teletext    
OL,8,    pages. While many channels offered  
OL,9,    little more than a basic TV guide,  
OL,10,    there were exceptions, such as the  
OL,11,   GamazingBParamount Text.             
OL,13,    PText's letters page,BMailbox,Gwas  
OL,14,    something of a cult hit. It was a  G
OL,15,    bulletin board for discussions from 
OL,16,    the serious to the surreal, updated 
OL,17,    daily, with anything up to a hundred
OL,18,    messages, by its dedicated editor.  
OL,20,    I was an avid reader, although I was
OL,21,    too shy to even think about calling
