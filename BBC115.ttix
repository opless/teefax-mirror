OL,4,CWhy families in Italy can't say goodbye
OL,5,Cto the dead
OL,6, Italy has banned funerals because of
OL,7, the coronavirus crisis. For many, the
OL,8, virus is now robbing families of the
OL,9, chance to say a final goodbye. 
OL,11,F"This pandemic kills twice," says
OL,12,FAndrea Cerato, who works in a funeral
OL,13,Fhome in Milan. "First, it isolates you
OL,14,Ffrom your loved ones right before you
OL,15,Fdie. Then, it doesn't allow anyone to
OL,16,Fget closure."
OL,18,F"Families are devastated and find it
OL,19,Fhard to accept."
