OL,6, In early August, Spain's former King
OL,7, Juan Carlos left the country following
OL,8, allegations of financial wrongdoing.
OL,9, But the country's affection for its
OL,10, monarch began to unravel as far back as
OL,11, 2012, following an ill-fated elephant
OL,12, hunt. With the king on that safari was
OL,13, his former lover Corinna zu
OL,14, Sayn-Wittgenstein. She talks

OL,17, Carlos, her claims of harassment by

OL,19, elephant.
