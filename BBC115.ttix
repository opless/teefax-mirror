OL,4,CQuebec town of Asbestos seeks new name
OL,5, The small Canadian town of Asbestos has
OL,6, decided it is time for a rebrand - and
OL,7, that means it is doing away with the
OL,8, name derived from its mining heritage.
OL,10,FThe Quebec town, home to some 7,000
OL,11,Fpeople, was once the location of the
OL,12,Fworld's largest asbestos mine. 
OL,14,FIt was given after English name for the
OL,15,Fmineral - rather than the French
OL,16,F"amiante" - in the late 19th century.
OL,18,FThe town's council now says the
OL,19,Fconnotation hinders its ability to
OL,20,Fattract foreign investment.
