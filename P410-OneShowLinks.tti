OL,6, What was teletext? It was an electronic
OL,7, magazine hidden in the TV signal that  
OL,8, could be viewed using any TV that had  
OL,9, a decoder. It delivered news, sport,   
OL,10, weather, TV and radio schedules. The   
OL,11, commercial channels also sold holidays 
OL,12, and other services. In the era before  
OL,13, the internet it was the fastest way to 
OL,14, get information.                       
OL,16,FUsing the technology of the 1970s it   
OL,17,Fwas limited to 24 rows of 40 characters
OL,18,For blocky graphics and seven colours.  
OL,20,FThis meant that stories were stripped  
OL,21,Fto the essentials and perfect for      
OL,22,Fstaying up to date on the news.
