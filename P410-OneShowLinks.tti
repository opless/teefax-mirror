OL,5,CThe ONE SHOW                           
OL,6,FWhat was teletext? It was an electronic
OL,7,Fmagazine hidden in the TV signal that  
OL,8,Fcould be viewed using any TV that had  
OL,9,Fa decoder. It delivered news, sport,   
OL,10,Fweather, TV and radio schedules. The   
OL,11,Fcommercial channels also sold holidays 
OL,12,Fand other services. In the era before  
OL,13,Fthe internet it was the fastest media  
OL,14,Fsource.                                
OL,16,FUsing the technology of the 1970s it   
OL,17,Fwas limited to 24 rows of 40 characters
OL,18,For blocky graphics and seven colours.  
OL,20,FThis meant that stories were stripped  
OL,21,Fto the essentials and perfect for      
OL,22,Fquick catchups.
