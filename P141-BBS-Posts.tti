OL,13, what TEEFAX users we have already and  
OL,14, where you all come from, are we all    
OL,15, from the UK or do we have some ARD777

OL,9,F"Nerdiest" is, I think, something of an
OL,10,Funderstatement.  Especially as this is 
OL,11,Fthe third time I've typed this - I have

OL,15, I've been exporting an edit-tf link    
OL,16, from wxTED and editing there as I find 
OL,17, the point-and-click mosaics editor eas-
OL,18, ier to use. Edit-tf has issue of its   
OL,19, own mind. I was just happy to dicscover
OL,20, that people have created editing tools 
OL,21, at all. They beat my previous method   
OL,22, hand editing binary files or files of  
OL,23, comma-separated hex values! :-)

OL,3, Yep. edit.tf is substantially easier. I
OL,4, must see if I can automate a transfer  
OL,5, of pages from my BBC Micro - I'm still 
OL,6, typing the escape codes for Prestel;   
OL,7, they must have become hard wired into

OL,3, Bit of both, but transferring is not   
OL,4, hard. I've got real editing keyboards, 
OL,5, both a Softel CEEFAX unit, but also    
OL,6, some bare Cherry units that need TLC...

OL,21, see the Econet fileserver, so can even 
OL,22, copy pages off disc via a real Beeb...

OL,3, Having looked again at beebem, it isn't
OL,4, able to export blocks of memory the way
OL,5, I was thinking it could. I now remember
OL,6, it was a painful process of copying    
OL,7, data from the debugger for the screens 
OL,8, I did. A better answer would be to     
OL,9, write it out into .tti format by set-

OL,3, It's common on spectrum ones. So get-  
OL,4, ting files out onto the host side isn't
OL,5, an issue then. It just means remember-
