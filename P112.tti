OL,5, A judge in Mexico has delivered a fresh
OL,6, blow to the Maya train project, which  
OL,7, aims to link archaeological sites with 
OL,8, Mexican beach resorts.                 
OL,10,FThe judge ordered that a suspension of 
OL,11,Fconstruction work on a stretch of the  
OL,12,Ftrain line be extended until its       
OL,13,Fenvironmental impact is determined.    
OL,15,FThe ruling is a victory for a group of 
OL,16,Fcave divers who fear that the works    
OL,17,Fwill threaten underground caverns.     
OL,19,FThe Maya train is one of Mexico's most 
OL,20,Fambitious infrastructure projects.
