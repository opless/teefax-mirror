OL,5, Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has
OL,6, pulled out of the contest to become the

OL,9,FIn a letter to the Times, he said he   
OL,10,Fwas not going to re-apply for the role,
OL,11,Fafter his initial application was      
OL,12,Frejected by a recruitment panel.       
OL,14,FThe process is currently being re-run  
OL,15,Fafter the initial interviews failed to
