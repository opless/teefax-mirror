OL,5, Streaming platform Twitch has been     
OL,6, forced to abandon a loosening of its   
OL,7, policy on sexual content because it led
OL,8, to a flood of AI-generated nudity.     
OL,10,FIt announced on Wednesday that more    
OL,11,Fadult content was to be allowed, as    
OL,12,Flong as it was deemed artistic.        
OL,14,FThat prompted a torrent of digitally   
OL,15,Fgenerated nudes, and by Friday the firm
OL,16,Fannounced a U-turn.
