OL,5, The UK's financial watchdog has        
OL,6, announced plans to shake up its rules  
OL,7, in a bid to attract more companies to  
OL,8, list shares on UK stock markets.       
OL,10,FThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  
OL,11,Fsaid its proposals would simplify      
OL,12,Fregulations to make the UK "more       
OL,13,Fcompetitive" with stock markets abroad.
OL,15,FBut there are concerns the changes     
OL,16,Fcould erode shareholders' rights.      
OL,18,FThe move comes after British tech firm 
OL,19,FArm and other businesses have shunned  
OL,20,Fthe UK and chosen to list in the US.
