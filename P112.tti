OL,5, Neo-Nazi Anders Brevik, who killed 77  
OL,6, people in Norway in 2011, has lost his 
OL,7, case against the state in a bid to end 
OL,8, his years of isolation in prison.      
OL,10,FBreivik had sued the Norwegian         
OL,11,Fauthorities, claiming his conditions   
OL,12,Fwere "inhumane" and he was suicidal.   
OL,14,FBut a court ruled on Thursday that     
OL,15,FBreivik's sentencing terms were "not a 
OL,16,Fviolation of human rights".            
OL,18,FBreivik's lawyer said his client was   
OL,19,Fdisappointed with the outcome and would
OL,20,Fappeal against the latest judgment.
