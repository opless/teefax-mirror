OL,6, criticism after calling those who have 
OL,7, died of hunger in his country "idiots".
OL,9,FMany have deemed Henry Okello Oryem's  
OL,10,Fcomments tone-deaf.                    
OL,12,FIn 2022, more than 2,200 people died of
OL,13,Fstarvation and related illnesses in    
OL,14,Fnorth-east Uganda, a report by an      
OL,15,Fofficial human rights body said.       
OL,17,FBut Mr Oryem argued that given Uganda's
OL,18,Ffavourable climate and fertile land,   
OL,19,Fpeople should be able to grow food for 
OL,20,Fthemselves.
