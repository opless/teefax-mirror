OL,5, JD Sports has hit out at the UK's      
OL,6, competition watchdog after being forced
OL,7, to sell rival chain Footasylum.        
OL,9,FAfter an investigation, the Competition
OL,10,Fand Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that 
OL,11,Fthe takeover could lead to a "worse    
OL,12,Fdeal" for customers.                   
OL,14,FBut JD Sports criticised the move,     
OL,15,Fcalling the decision "inexplicable" and
OL,16,F"beyond logic".                        
OL,18,FIts chairman Peter Cowgill suggested   
OL,19,Fthat the CMA is in "a minority of one  
OL,20,Fin reaching this conclusion".
