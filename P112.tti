OL,5, When six-year-old Carol Allison spent a
OL,6, year in Edinburgh with her granny, she 
OL,7, was taken every week to the bank to    
OL,8, deposit a shilling into her account.   
OL,10,FMore than 60 years later, she found the
OL,11,Fforgotten bank book while tidying her  
OL,12,Fhouse in the city's Stockbridge area.  
OL,14,FShe took it along to her bank, and     
OL,15,Ffound that the #2.50 she had deposited 
OL,16,Fwas now worth #250 - and that the money
OL,17,Fwas still there for her to collect.    
OL,19,FCarol is urging others to reclaim money
OL,20,Ffrom old accounts.
