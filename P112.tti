OL,5, The actress Samantha Morton has accused
OL,6, the government of being "neglectful"   
OL,7, towards 16 and 17-year-olds in care.   
OL,9,FThe law changed last September so      
OL,10,Funder-16s must be in regulated settings
OL,11,Flike children's homes or foster care.  
OL,13,FThat does not apply to older teens, who
OL,14,Fcan be in supported or semi-independent
OL,15,Faccommodation such as a hostel.        
OL,17,FMs Morton - who lived in care and was  
OL,18,Fhomeless at 16 - expressed anger that, 
OL,19,Fnearly 30 years later, many still find 
OL,20,Fthemselves without sufficient support.
