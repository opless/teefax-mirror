OL,6, introduce a national ban on Nazi       
OL,7, symbols, in an effort to crack down on 
OL,8, far-right groups.                      
OL,10,FPublic displays of the swastika or SS  
OL,11,Fsymbols will be punishable by up to a  
OL,12,Fyear in prison. However the new laws   
OL,13,Fwill not cover the Nazi salute.        
OL,15,FNazi symbols are already banned in many
