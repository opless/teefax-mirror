OL,5, This was history in the making - and   
OL,6, you had to pinch yourself to think you 
OL,7, were seeing it close-up, inside        
OL,8, Westminster Abbey.                     
OL,10,FOver there was the battered but rather 
OL,11,Fbeautiful Coronation chair, with a King
OL,12,Fabout to be crowned. It looked almost  
OL,13,Ffragile waiting for its royal occupant.
OL,15,FYou could feel the sense of            
OL,16,Fexpectation. It was really happening   
OL,17,Fright here, on an altar full of        
OL,18,Fcandlelight, prayers and a glow of     
OL,19,Fgold. The Abbey was like being inside a
OL,20,Fjewel box.
