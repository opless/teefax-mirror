OL,5, The Australian government has bought   
OL,6, the Aboriginal flag's copyright in a   
OL,7, bid to "free" the symbol of identity   
OL,8, from bitter fights over who can use it.
OL,10,FIndigenous artist Harold Thomas created
OL,11,Fthe flag in 1971 as a protest image but
OL,12,Fit is now the dominant Aboriginal      
OL,13,Femblem and an official national flag.  
OL,15,FDespite this, many Aboriginal people   
OL,16,Fsay the flag has been "held hostage" by
OL,17,Fcopyright deals that limit its display.
OL,19,FThe flag can now be reproduced by      
OL,20,Fanyone without fear of legal threats.
