OL,5, West Side Story and The Power of the   
OL,6, Dog were the big winners at a subdued  
OL,7, Golden Globe Awards ceremony on Sunday.
OL,9,FThis year's event was dramatically     
OL,10,Fpared down - it took place without any 
OL,11,Fcelebrities in attendance and the      
OL,12,Fceremony was not even televised.       
OL,14,FThe muted nature of this year's event  
OL,15,Ffollows allegations of corruption and a
OL,16,Flack of diversity in its voting body.

OL,19,Ftook place in Los Angeles without a red
OL,20,Fcarpet or official press access.
