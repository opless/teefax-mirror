OL,5, Aldi's claim it had "Britain's cheapest
OL,6, Christmas dinner" was found to be      
OL,7, misleading after Sainsbury's reported  
OL,8, it to the advertising watchdog.        
OL,10,FAn advert stated that consumer group   
OL,11,FWhich? had found Aldi's festive meal   
OL,12,Fwas 20% cheaper than Sainsbury's.
