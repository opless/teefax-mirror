OL,5, The government has rejected calls for a
OL,6, legal definition of honour-based abuse.
OL,8,FThe Women and Equalities Committee     
OL,9,F(WEC) recommended the definition in its
OL,10,Freport into honour-based abuse in July.
OL,12,FOn Friday, the government responded by 
OL,13,Fsaying it already has a working        
OL,14,Fdefinition used by the Home Office and 
OL,15,Fthe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).   
OL,17,F"It is not clear that making the
