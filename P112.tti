OL,5, MPs have backed setting the cost of    
OL,6, ground rents on new houses in England  
OL,7, and Wales at "one peppercorn" a year.  
OL,9,FThe government-sponsored plan, if it   
OL,10,Fbecomes law, will effectively leave    
OL,11,Fowners who buy only leases - rather    
OL,12,Fthan freeholds - paying nothing.       
OL,14,FThe move follows concerns that         
OL,15,Fleaseholders are being charged         
OL,16,Fexorbitant, fast-rising ground rents.  
OL,18,FBut Labour says ministers need to go   
OL,19,Ffurther and completely ban the selling 
OL,20,Fof houses without a freehold.
