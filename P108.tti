OL,5, TikTok is driving online frenzies that 
OL,6, encourage anti-social behaviour in the 
OL,7, real world, a BBC Three investigation  
OL,8, reveals.                               
OL,10,FEx-employees say the issue is not being
OL,11,Ftackled for fear of slowing the growth

OL,14,FThese frenzies - where TikTok drives   
OL,15,Fdisproportionate amounts of engagement 
OL,16,Fto some topics - are evidenced by      
OL,17,Finterviews with former staffers, app   
OL,18,Fusers and BBC analysis of wider social 
OL,19,Fmedia data. They have then led to
