OL,5, An organiser of a "whites only" party  
OL,6, in Sri Lanka has apologised after the  
OL,7, event sparked a backlash online.       
OL,9,FThe event's advertisement specified a  
OL,10,Fwhite dress code, but also had a line  
OL,11,Fsaying "Face control: White" - which   
OL,12,Fwas largely interpreted to mean the    
OL,13,Fevent was open only to white people.   
OL,15,FAn organiser later said the event was  
OL,16,F"a bad idea", adding that it was meant 
OL,17,Fto bring together expatriates.         
OL,19,FThe party, which was due to take place 
OL,20,Flast Saturday, was cancelled.
