OL,4,CMast Upgrade: UK experiment could sweep
OL,5,Caside fusion hurdle
OL,6, Initial results from a UK experiment
OL,7, could help clear a hurdle to achieving
OL,8, commercial power based on nuclear
OL,9, fusion, experts say.
OL,11,FThe researchers believe they now have a
OL,12,Fway to remove the excess heat produced
OL,13,Fby fusion reactions.
OL,15,FThis intense heat can melt materials
OL,16,Fused inside a reactor, limiting the
OL,17,Famount of time it can operate for.
OL,19,FThe system, which has been likened to a
OL,20,Fcar exhaust, resulted in a tenfold
OL,21,Freduction in the heat.
