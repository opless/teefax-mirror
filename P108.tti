OL,5, Petrol prices have risen for the fourth
OL,6, month in a row, jumping by 4.5p a litre
OL,7, on average last month, the RAC says.   
OL,9,FUnleaded went up from about #1.52 to   
OL,10,F#1.57 in September, pushing the cost of
OL,11,Ffilling a family car to over #86.      
OL,13,FThe RAC said increased fuel costs were 
OL,14,Fbeing driven by higher global oil      
OL,15,Fprices, but it also claimed that petrol
OL,16,Fwas being "overpriced".                
OL,18,FBut independent forecourts said they   
OL,19,Fwere "not unjustifiably pricing petrol 
OL,20,Fhigher than needed".
