OL,5, On a day of political drama not seen in
OL,6, Congress for a century, Republican     
OL,7, leader Kevin McCarthy repeatedly failed
OL,8, in his bid to be elected Speaker of the
OL,9, US House of Representatives. What      
OL,10, happens now?                           
OL,12,FThe start of a new Congress was        
OL,13,Fsupposed to be a victory lap for the   
OL,14,FRepublican Party as it took control of 
OL,15,Fthe lower chamber following November's 
OL,16,Felections. Instead, Mr McCarthy faced a
OL,17,Frebellion from within his own ranks and
OL,18,Fmade history for all the wrong reasons.
