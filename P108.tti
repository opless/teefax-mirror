OL,5, Some children with cancer are receiving
OL,6, a new type of drug treatment far less  
OL,7, toxic than chemotherapy.               
OL,9,FArthur, 11, is one of the first to try 
OL,10,Fit, at London's Great Ormond Street    
OL,11,FHospital, for his blood cancer.        
OL,13,FHis family call the therapy "a little  
OL,14,Fbit of sunshine", since it worked      
OL,15,Fwithout making Arthur feel much sicker.
OL,17,FAnd because it could be given on the   
OL,18,Fgo, rather than just in hospital, he
