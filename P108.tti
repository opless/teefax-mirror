OL,5, Florida's top court has paved the way  
OL,6, for the state's six-week abortion ban  
OL,7, to take effect, but is allowing voters 
OL,8, to have their say on the issue.        
OL,10,FThe justices have upheld the state's   
OL,11,F15-week ban on abortion, in a ruling   
OL,12,Fthat means a subsequently passed       
OL,13,Fsix-week ban can soon begin.           
OL,15,FBut the court will also let Floridians 
OL,16,Fdecide in November if abortion rights  
OL,17,Fshould be sealed in the state charter. 
OL,19,FMost Americans back legalised abortion,
OL,20,Fbut most also favour restrictions.
