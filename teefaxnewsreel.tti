OL,6, Police investigations of gang murders
OL,7, are increasingly held back by a "wall
OL,8, of silence", the BBC has found, with
OL,9, witnesses across the country unwilling
OL,10, to give evidence. The trend emerged
OL,11, during the BBC's First 100 Killings
OL,12, project which has tracked homicides
OL,13, from the start of 2019 and monitored
OL,14, dozens of murder trials. Youth workers,
OL,15, police and prosecutors believe
OL,16, witnesses are afraid for their own
