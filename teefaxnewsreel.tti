OL,6, Labour "pursued a path of almost comic

OL,11,FIn a speech in London, the ex-PM said
OL,12,Fhe believed the party could have kept
OL,13,Fmuch of the vote in traditional Labour
OL,14,Fareas under a different leadership.
OL,16,FThe situation was "made impossible by
OL,17,Ffailure to take a clear position and to
OL,18,Fstick to it", Mr Blair said.
OL,20,F"The result has brought shame on us. We
OL,21,Flet our country down," he added.
