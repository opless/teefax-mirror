OL,12, and vision of a group of British
OL,13, workers.
OL,15,FIn 1977, Star Wars was still little
OL,16,Fmore than a rumour. The first film in

OL,6, When the American Bobby Fischer
OL,7, challenged the Russian Boris Spassky
OL,8, for the World Chess Championship in
OL,9, 1972 the media looked on in

OL,13, the historic match.
OL,16,FNo one had seriously considered chess
OL,17,Fas prime-time material. But then along
OL,18,Fcame the unique and deeply troubled
