OL,4,CThe unexpected rise of Japan's new
OL,5,Cprime minister
OL,6, Shinzo Abe was Japan's prime minister
OL,7, for so long that people around the
OL,8, world came to recognise his face and
OL,9, perhaps even knew how to pronounce his
OL,10, name. So, should we all now be learning
OL,11, how to say Yoshihide Suga? That is a
OL,12, difficult question to answer. 
OL,14,FA month ago, there were very few who
OL,15,Fwould have predicted what we are now
OL,16,Fwitnessing. Firstly no one expected Mr
OL,17,FAbe to go, certainly not before his
OL,18,Fbeloved Tokyo Olympics. Even fewer
OL,19,Fwould have guessed Mr Suga as his
OL,20,Freplacement.
