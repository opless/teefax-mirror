OL,6, When a ship bound for east Africa was
OL,7, detained in Portland off the south
OL,8, coast of England in November, its
OL,9, Russian crew feared they would be
OL,10, stranded indefinitely.

OL,13,Fhas befallen other seafarers in their
OL,14,Fsituation - hundreds have been stuck on
OL,15,Ftheir vessels, some for years, when
OL,16,Ftheir ships' owners have run out of
OL,17,Fmoney. Sailors who leave their ships in
OL,18,Fthese circumstances risk never being
OL,19,Fbeing paid and so feel they have to
OL,20,Fstay put.
