OL,4,  What makes a ukulele go out of tune?  
OL,6,F All strings stretch. The pitch droops 
OL,7,F as they stretch and new strings       
OL,8,F stretch the fastest.                  
OL,9,F                                       
OL,10,F I don't know too much about string    
OL,11,F brands but better ukuleles come with  
OL,12,F Aquila strings. These sound and feel  
OL,13,F great. If you have a very cheap uke   
OL,14,F with unbranded strings you'll get an  
OL,15,F improvement with a quality string set.
OL,17,F Whatever strings you fit you'll be    
OL,18,F constantly retuning for a few days.
