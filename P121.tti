OL,5, US basketball player Brittney Griner   
OL,6, has been sent to a Russian penal colony
OL,7, in a remote region south-east of Moscow
OL,8, to serve a nine-year jail term for     
OL,9, illegal drug possession. She joins tens
OL,10, of thousands of Russian women behind   
OL,11, bars - and no-one knows how long she   
OL,12, will serve, as the US is keen to       
OL,13, organise a prisoner-swap to release    
OL,14, her.                                   
OL,16,FUntil that happens, her life inside a  
OL,17,FRussian jail will certainly not be     
OL,18,Feasy, and she will likely endure       
OL,19,Fconditions as regular as any other
