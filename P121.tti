OL,5, About 30 years ago, just months after  
OL,6, starting work as a prostitute, Maxine  
OL,7, Doogan became pregnant.                
OL,9,FShe had been with a new client at a    
OL,10,Fmassage parlour in Anchorage, Alaska,  
OL,11,Fwhen she realised he had removed his   
OL,12,Fcondom surreptitiously during          
OL,13,Fintercourse. Shocked, she ran to the   
OL,14,Fbathroom. When she returned the client 
OL,15,Fwas gone.                              
OL,17,FDoogan, then in her mid-twenties, went 
OL,18,Fto a nearby health clinic for a round  
OL,19,Fof tests for sexually transmitted      
OL,20,Finfections and later gave a silent     
OL,21,Fthanks for each negative result.
