OL,5, A grandmother has revealed a family    
OL,6, treasure: an uneaten Easter egg that   
OL,7, could be one of the oldest in Wales.   
OL,9,FSally Evans's brother was just 14 when 
OL,10,Fhe bought her the egg in 1951 as an    
OL,11,FEaster gift.                           
OL,13,F"It was just something that was too    
OL,14,Fvaluable to eat," Sally, now 83, said. 
OL,16,FAt the time war rationing was still in 
OL,17,Fforce, making chocolate hard to come   
OL,18,Fby. So the egg was tucked away in a    
OL,19,Fcupboard, first by her mother, and     
OL,20,Fsince 2002 in her own home.
