OL,5, The opposition in Togo has denounced a 
OL,6, proposed new constitution as a power   
OL,7, grab, intended to extend the reign of  
OL,8, President Faure Gnassingbe.            
OL,10,FThe reforms would see the West African 
OL,11,Fcountry move from a presidential to a  
OL,12,Fparliamentary system. But the          
OL,13,Fopposition says they are a ruse to keep
OL,14,FMr Gnassingbe - already in his fourth  
OL,15,Fterm - in power.                       
OL,19,FPresident Gnassingbe came to power in  
OL,20,F2005 after the death of his father, who
OL,21,Fhad been president since 1967.
