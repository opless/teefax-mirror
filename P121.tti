OL,6, what it calls "the international LGBT  
OL,7, public movement" an extremist          
OL,8, organisation and banned its activities 
OL,9, across the country.                    
OL,11,FThe ruling was prompted by a motion    
OL,12,Ffrom the justice ministry, even though 
OL,13,Fno such organisation exists as a legal
