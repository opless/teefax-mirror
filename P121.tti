OL,6, Google has made changes to its mapping
OL,7, service after fears that walkers may
OL,8, mistakenly attempt a "potentially
OL,9, fatal" route up Ben Nevis.
OL,11,FThe firm insisted its walking
OL,12,Fdirections on Google Maps did not
OL,13,Fdirect people to dangerous routes.
OL,15,FHowever, its driving directions took
OL,16,Fpeople to a car park where a dotted
OL,17,Fline showing distance to the summit
OL,18,Fcould be misinterpreted by users.
OL,20,FIn future the maps will direct drivers
OL,21,Fto a visitor centre instead.
