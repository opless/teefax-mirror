OL,5, A key finding in the latest IPCC       
OL,6, climate report has been widely         
OL,7, misinterpreted, according to scientists
OL,8, involved in the study.                 
OL,10,FIn the document, researchers wrote that
OL,11,Fgreenhouse gases are projected to peak 
OL,12,F"at the latest before 2025".           
OL,14,FThis implies that carbon could increase
OL,15,Ffor another three years and the world  
OL,16,Fcould still avoid dangerous warming.   
OL,18,FBut scientists say that's incorrect and
OL,19,Fthat emissions need to fall            
OL,20,Fimmediately.
