OL,5, The Archbishop of Canterbury has       
OL,6, apologised for saying a "significant   
OL,7, cloud" hung over the name of the late  
OL,8, Bishop of Chichester George Bell.      
OL,10,FIn 1995 a woman alleged Mr Bell - who  
OL,11,Fdied in 1958 - sexually abused her as a
OL,12,Fgirl. The police were only called in   
OL,13,Fafter she wrote to Mr Welby in 2013.   
OL,15,FThe Church settled with her out of     
OL,16,Fcourt in 2015 and issued an apology.   
OL,18,FHowever, a review of the case in 2017  
OL,19,Fsaid the Church "rushed to judgement"  
OL,20,Fin assuming Mr Bell's guilt.
