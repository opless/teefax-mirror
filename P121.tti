OL,5, When the rainstorm hit Petropolis last 
OL,6, week, 41-year-old Carine Santiago was  
OL,7, nervous. Brazil is a country used to   
OL,8, tropical downpours and people here take
OL,9, rainy season in their stride. But even 
OL,10, by Brazilian standards, it was intense.
OL,12,FThe town saw a month's worth of rain - 
OL,13,F240 mm (9.4 in)- in just two hours.    
OL,15,F"The rain came down so hard," Carine   
OL,16,Fsays. She was trapped at work, while   
OL,17,Fher daughter was at home. "I had no    
OL,18,Fidea that where I lived it was even    
OL,19,Fworse."
