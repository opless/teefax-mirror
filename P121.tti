OL,5, Happy the elephant, a long-time        
OL,6, resident of the Bronx Zoo, must remain 
OL,7, there after a New York court ruled she 
OL,8, is not legally a person under US law.  
OL,10,FOn Tuesday, the state's highest court  
OL,11,Fvoted 5-2 to reject an animal rights   
OL,12,Fgroup's argument that Happy was being  
OL,13,Fillegally confined at the zoo.         
OL,15,FWhile elephants are "impressive", the

OL,17,Fthe same liberty rights as humans.     
OL,19,FThe animal rights group sought to have 
OL,20,FHappy moved to an elephant sanctuary.
