OL,5, A television presenter whose abusive   
OL,6, ex-husband was due for prison release  
OL,7, this week said this is "the start of a 
OL,8, whole new chapter" for her.            
OL,10,FJonathan Wignall was sentenced to three
OL,11,Fyears for stalking and coercive and    
OL,12,Fcontrolling behaviour.                 
OL,14,FNot knowing where or when Wignall is   
OL,15,Freleased is "tough", Ms Dodsworth said.
OL,17,FShe understands the need to protect    
OL,18,Fex-offenders, but that uncertainty     
OL,19,F"heightens that sense of looking over  
OL,20,Fyour shoulder".
