OL,5, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned   
OL,6, people to "buckle up" as he signed a   
OL,7, bill giving the state control over     
OL,8, Disney's sprawling Orlando theme parks.
OL,10,FThe bill strips power uniquely held by 
OL,11,FDisney for over 50 years and enables   
OL,12,Fmore oversight by Mr DeSantis'         
OL,13,FRepublican-led legislature.            
OL,15,FThe move is seen as retaliation after  
OL,16,FDisney opposed state laws curtailing   
OL,17,Fgender and sexuality education.        
OL,19,FIt precedes a likely 2024 presidential 
OL,20,Frun by Mr DeSantis.
