OL,5, The northern Ukrainian city of         
OL,6, Chernihiv has been almost completely   
OL,7, encircled by Russian forces and left   
OL,8, without electricity, gas or running    
OL,9, water. Tens of thousands of people     
OL,10, remain trapped. Some have described    
OL,11, civilian buildings and residential     
OL,12, areas being deliberately targeted.     
OL,15,FThe couple, and probably everyone else 
OL,16,Fleft in Chernihiv, spend most of their 
OL,17,Ftime hiding behind thick walls. "Thank 
OL,18,FGod we have them," Anna said. Their    
OL,19,Fson, who is 12, rarely ventures        
OL,20,Foutside. "He's in panic. Many children 
OL,21,Fare afraid of going out."
