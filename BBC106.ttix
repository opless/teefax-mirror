OL,4,CScientists revive ancient microbes from
OL,5,Cthe sea
OL,6, Japanese scientists say they have
OL,7, revived microbes that were in a dormant
OL,8, state for more than 100 million years. 
OL,10,FThe tiny organisms had survived in the
OL,11,FSouth Pacific seabed - in sediment that
OL,12,Fis poor in nutrients, but has enough
OL,13,Foxygen to allow them to live. 
OL,15,FMicrobes are among the earth's simplest
OL,16,Forganisms, and some can live in extreme
OL,17,Fenvironments where more developed life
OL,18,Fforms cannot survive.
