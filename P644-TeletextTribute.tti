OL,1,M]DA note about this page...      0/16  
OL,4,CWhen CEEFAX closed down on 23rd October
OL,5,C2012, I put together a special tribute 
OL,6,Cfor my YouTube channel.                
OL,8, This was a blog of my own memories of  
OL,9, the service, presented as a series of  
OL,10, teletext pages with music, in the style
OL,11, of the "Pages from Ceefax" in-vision.  
OL,13, The pages were originally created in a 
OL,14, demo version of the Cebra editor, and a
OL,15, BBC Micro emulator was used to create  
OL,16, an authentic-looking teletext display. 
OL,18, I have converted the original "pages"  
OL,19, to the TTI format used by Teefax/VBitPi
OL,21, The original video can still be seen at

OL,6,    satellite channels appeared, most of
OL,7,    which carried their own teletext    
OL,8,    pages. While many channels offered  
OL,9,    little more than a basic TV guide,  
OL,10,    there were exceptions, such as the  
OL,11,   GamazingBParamount Text.             
OL,13,    PText's letters page,BMailbox,Gwas  
OL,14,    something of a cult hit. It was a  G
OL,15,    bulletin board for discussions from 
OL,16,    the serious to the surreal, updated 
OL,17,    daily, with anything up to a hundred
OL,18,    messages, by its dedicated editor.  
OL,20,    I was an avid reader, although I was
OL,21,    too shy to even think about calling
