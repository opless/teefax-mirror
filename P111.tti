OL,5, When the Russian offensive started, as 
OL,6, sirens sounded in Kyiv for the first   
OL,7, time, some people here feared that the 
OL,8, city might fall by the afternoon.      
OL,12,FThe first two weeks of the war proved  
OL,13,Fthat those predictions were wrong. The 
OL,14,FRussians blundered; the Ukrainians     
OL,15,Fresisted. Around Kyiv the Russian      
OL,16,Fadvance stalled. In the south, it was a
OL,17,Fdifferent story. They worked steadily  
OL,18,Ftowards opening a land corridor between
OL,19,FCrimea and Moscow's enclaves in eastern
OL,20,FUkraine.
