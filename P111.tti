OL,5, A Palestinian mayor whose offer of a   
OL,6, bounty for killing stray dogs caused   
OL,7, outrage among animal-lovers has        
OL,8, backtracked, saying he was joking.     
OL,10,FHebron Mayor Tayseer Abu Sneineh had   
OL,11,Fsaid those who killed strays in his    
OL,12,Fcity could get 20 shekels ($5.8; 5.7   
OL,13,Feuros) per dog.                        
OL,15,FStills and videos were then widely     
OL,16,Fshared on social media which apparently
OL,17,Fshowed dogs being killed or abused.    
OL,19,FAnother mayor then encouraged people to
OL,20,Falso shoot dogs in his city.
