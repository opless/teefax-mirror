OL,5, A new way of sucking carbon dioxide    
OL,6, from the air and storing it in the sea 
OL,7, has been outlined by scientists.       
OL,9,FThe authors say that this novel        
OL,10,Fapproach captures CO2 from the         
OL,11,Fatmosphere up to three times more      
OL,12,Fefficiently than current methods.      
OL,14,FThe warming gas can be transformed into
OL,15,Fbicarbonate of soda and stored safely  
OL,16,Fand cheaply in seawater.               
OL,18,FThe new method could speed up the
