OL,6, he left GB News over the direction the 
OL,7, channel was taking, saying he became a 
OL,8, "minority of one" within management.   
OL,10,FThe journalist told BBC Question Time  
OL,11,Fhe would let people "make up their own 
OL,12,Fminds" over whether his exit was       
OL,13,Fbecause the channel was too right wing.
OL,15,FHe also described the launch of the new
OL,16,Fstation as not a "startling success".
