OL,6, bird of the year, in a controversial   
OL,7, move that has ruffled feathers.        
OL,9,FThe long-tailed bat had swooped in to  
OL,10,Fclinch the title following an online   
OL,11,Fpoll.                                  
OL,13,FContest organisers had included the    
OL,14,Fbat, one of the country's few          
OL,15,Fland-based native mammals, to raise its
OL,16,Fprofile as a critically endangered     
OL,17,Fspecies.
