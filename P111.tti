OL,5, The government is considering          
OL,6, announcing a new tax on vapes at the   
OL,7, Budget next week.                      
OL,9,FCurrently, vaping products are subject 
OL,10,Fto VAT - but unlike tobacco, they are  
OL,11,Fnot also subject to a separate levy.   
OL,13,FTobacco duty could also increase at the
OL,14,FBudget, to ensure that vaping remains  
OL,15,Fcheaper.                               
OL,17,FMinisters fear that the relatively     
OL,18,Fcheap cost of vaping means that the    
OL,19,Fproducts are more accessible for young 
OL,20,Fpeople and non-smokers.
