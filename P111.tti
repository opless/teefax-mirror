OL,5, A six-month extension has been applied 
OL,6, to a temporary policy that allows women
OL,7, to take medical abortion pills at home.
OL,9,FThe measure was initially introduced   
OL,10,Fwhen Covid hit, so that women would not
OL,11,Fhave to visit a clinic and, instead,   
OL,12,Fcould access treatment after a         
OL,13,Ftelephone or online consultation.      
OL,15,FMedical abortion involves taking two   
OL,16,Fdifferent medicines to end pregnancy.

OL,19,Fpill could be taken at home, not the   
OL,20,Ffirst.
