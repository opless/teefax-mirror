OL,5, Scotland's health secretary Michael    
OL,6, Matheson has resigned ahead of a report
OL,7, into an #11,000 bill that was racked up
OL,8, on his parliamentary iPad.             
OL,10,FMr Matheson said he was standing down  
OL,11,Fbecause he did not want the row over   
OL,12,Fthe bill to become a distraction.      
OL,14,FThe iPad charges, initially paid out of
OL,15,Fthe public purse, were incurred during 
OL,16,Fa family trip to Morocco in late 2022.

OL,20,Fonly been used for parliamentary work.
