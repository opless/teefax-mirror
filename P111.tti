OL,5, Climate change is causing the highest  
OL,6, glacier on Mount Everest to melt at a  
OL,7, rapid pace, a new study has found.     
OL,9,FResearchers led by the University of   
OL,10,FMaine found that the South Col Glacier 
OL,11,Fhas lost more than 180ft (54m) of      
OL,12,Fthickness in the last 25 years.        
OL,14,FThe glacier, which sits around 7,906m  
OL,15,F(25,938 ft) above sea-level, is        
OL,16,Fthinning 80 times faster than it first

OL,19,FThe rate of decline has been blamed on
