OL,5, Scientists have identified what was    
OL,6, probably the largest marine reptile    
OL,7, ever to swim in the seas - a creature  
OL,8, longer than two, nose-to-nose buses.   
OL,10,FThe creature lived around 202 million  
OL,11,Fyears ago alongside the dinosaurs.     
OL,13,FIts fossilised jawbone was found in    
OL,14,F2016 by a fossil hunter on a Somerset  
OL,15,Fbeach. In 2020 a father and daughter   
OL,16,Ffound a second, very similar jawbone.  
OL,18,FExperts now say the fossils are from   
OL,19,Ftwo giant ichthyosaur reptiles, which  
OL,20,Fcould have been 25m long.
