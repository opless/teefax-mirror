OL,6, walked away from making a takeover bid 
OL,7, for Currys after being rejected by the 
OL,8, retailer's board "multiple times".     
OL,10,FIt had initially proposed an offer that
OL,11,Fvalued the electricals chain at #700m, 
OL,12,Fand then raised it to #757m.           
OL,14,FBut Currys rebuffed the approaches,
