OL,5, A legal bid to protect tenants from so 
OL,6, called "ghost landlords" has failed, in
OL,7, a move that could have significant     
OL,8, implications for people looking to     
OL,9, claim their rent back if they live in  
OL,10, bad conditions.                        
OL,12,FIn a landmark ruling the Supreme Court 
OL,13,Fstated that a landlord is the person a 
OL,14,Ftenant signs their contract with, and  
OL,15,Fnot the property's owner               
OL,17,FHousing campaigners say the ruling will
OL,18,Fbe a "blueprint" for landlords to avoid
OL,19,Ftaking responsibility for properties.
