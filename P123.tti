OL,5, When Emily Hughes moved in to her new  
OL,6, house in Peterborough, one of the first
OL,7, things that needed tackling was the    
OL,8, heating system.                        
OL,10,F"With an ageing boiler, the bills were 
OL,11,Fmounting quickly," she says.           
OL,13,FTo be "ultra-efficient" she decided to 
OL,14,Finstall a whole new heating system.    
OL,15,FSolar panels were fitted to the house, 
OL,16,Falong with an air source heat pump. The
OL,17,Fheat pump and panels work together with
OL,18,Fa passive heating system - a mesh of   
OL,19,Fpipes encased in concrete, that stores 
OL,20,Fheat in summer and slowly releases it  
OL,21,Fover the winter.
