OL,5, On 27 May 1940, 97 British soldiers ran
OL,6, out of bullets and surrendered to the  
OL,7, Germans, expecting to be treated as    
OL,8, prisoners of war. Instead their dog    
OL,9, tags were removed, and they were lined 
OL,10, up and machine-gunned. Amazingly, two  
OL,11, men survived - and lived to see the SS 
OL,12, colonel who ordered the shooting       
OL,13, brought to justice.
