OL,5, Prosecutors in Donald Trump's upcoming 
OL,6, trial have asked for limits on what the
OL,7, ex-president can publicly say about the
OL,8, case, after he shared a threatening    
OL,9, message online.

OL,12,Fprosecutors said they feared Mr Trump  
OL,13,Fmight disclose confidential evidence.  
OL,15,FThey justified the move citing a post  
OL,16,Fby Mr Trump shared on Friday, saying it
