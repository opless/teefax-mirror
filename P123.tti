OL,5, The boss of Russian state-controlled   
OL,6, gas giant Gazprom has said it is a case
OL,7, of "our product, our rules" after the  
OL,8, firm halved its supply to Germany.     
OL,10,FThe German economy minister has accused
OL,11,FGazprom of attempting to push up energy
OL,12,Fprices by sharply reducing supplies.   
OL,14,FBut Gazprom said it was due to the     
OL,15,Fdelayed return of equipment serviced by
OL,16,FGermany's Siemens Energy in Canada.    
OL,18,FItaly and Austria have also reported   
OL,19,Fbig falls in Russian gas supply. The   
OL,20,FKremlin said this was not premeditated.
