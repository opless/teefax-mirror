OL,6, almost #15 would "absolutely" be too   
OL,7, much, the culture secretary has said.  
OL,9,FLucy Frazer said she was concerned a   
OL,10,F"significant rise" in the fee would add
OL,11,Fto cost of living pressures.           
OL,13,FThe licence fee has been frozen for the
OL,14,Flast two years at #159 but is due to   
OL,15,Frise in April in line with inflation.  
OL,17,FIt's currently expected to increase to
