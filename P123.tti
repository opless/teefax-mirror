OL,5, Donald Trump has lived his whole life  
OL,6, as though he is trying to prove the    
OL,7, theory that all publicity is good      
OL,8, publicity. His appearance in court on  
OL,9, Tuesday as a criminal defendant will   
OL,10, test that cliche to the limit.         
OL,12,FThis case has certainly put him back in
OL,13,Fthe spotlight. His journey from        
OL,14,FMar-a-Lago, his Florida home, to New   
OL,15,FYork was carried live on several US TV

OL,17,Fdiscussing with advisers how he should
