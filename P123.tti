OL,5, An Edinburgh woman says she is "sad and
OL,6, disappointed" after being forced to    
OL,7, repaint her pink front door.           
OL,9,FMiranda Dickson was ordered to change  
OL,10,Fthe colour last year after an anonymous
OL,11,Fcomplaint to City of Edinburgh Council.
OL,13,FThe local authority ruled that the pink
OL,14,Fdoor was not "in keeping with the      
OL,15,Fhistoric character" of the listed      
OL,16,Fbuilding in the city's New Town area.  
OL,18,FNow Ms Dickson, 49, has painted the    
OL,19,Fdoor green after failing to overturn   
OL,20,Fthe enforcement notice.
