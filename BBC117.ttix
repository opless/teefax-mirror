OL,4,CCan you fight fire with fire?
OL,5, As Australia battles unprecedented
OL,6, fires this year, a debate is under way
OL,7, about what is called "controlled
OL,8, burning" as a means to stop fires
OL,9, spreading.

OL,12,Ffires under controlled conditions to
OL,13,Fclear out low-lying flammable material
OL,14,F- sometimes called "prescribed" or
OL,15,F"hazard reduction burning".

OL,18,Fwhich is done as a last resort to try
OL,19,Fto slow down an approaching wildfire by
