OL,4,CWhy is there so little coronavirus
OL,5,Ctesting in Japan?
OL,6, Why is Japan not in lockdown? It's a
OL,7, question I've been asked numerous times
OL,8, by friends all over the world. That's
OL,9, not surprising given what's going on in
OL,10, Europe and America. But it is perhaps
OL,11, the wrong question. Taiwan, Hong Kong,
OL,12, South Korea and most of mainland China,
OL,13, have also never had full lockdowns. 
OL,15,FFor those trying to understand what's
OL,16,Fgoing on in Japan, the much more
OL,17,Fpuzzling question is why there is so
OL,18,Flittle testing for Covid-19.
