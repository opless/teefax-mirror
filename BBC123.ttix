OL,6, Getting all your cardboard recycled may
OL,7, often seem like a pain, but there is
OL,8, big money to be made from all this
OL,9, so-called "beige gold". And sadly this
OL,10, is attracting criminals around the
OL,11, world.
OL,13,FThieves are making a fortune from
OL,14,Fstealing used cardboard that's been
OL,15,Fleft out to be recycled, and selling it
OL,16,Fon. This means that legitimate
OL,17,Frecycling firms, and the city and other
OL,18,Flocal authorities who take a cut from
OL,19,Ftheir sales, are missing out on tens of
OL,20,Fmillions.
