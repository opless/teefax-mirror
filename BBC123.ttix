OL,4,CIs Nutella made with nuts picked by
OL,5,Cchildren?
OL,6, Nearly three-quarters of the world's
OL,7, hazelnuts come from Turkey and the
OL,8, biggest buyer is Ferrero, maker of
OL,9, Nutella, the chocolate and hazelnut
OL,10, spread. But the nuts are picked mainly
OL,11, by migrants, including children, who
OL,12, work long hours for very low pay. What
OL,13, is Ferrero doing to ensure its products
OL,14, do not depend on child labour?
OL,16,F"When we say 'hazelnut', in my
OL,17,Funderstanding it means misery: tough
OL,18,Fwork, being a worker," says Mehmet
OL,19,FKelekci as he hauls a 35kg sack of
OL,20,Ffreshly-picked nuts on to his back.
