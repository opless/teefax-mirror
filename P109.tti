OL,5, US President Joe Biden has defended his
OL,6, "very difficult decision" to give      
OL,7, Ukraine cluster bombs, which have a    
OL,8, record of killing civilians.           
OL,10,FThe president said it had taken him "a 
OL,11,Fwhile to be convinced to do it", but he
OL,12,Fhad acted because "the Ukrainians are  
OL,13,Frunning out of ammunition".            
OL,15,FUkraine's leader hailed the "timely"   
OL,16,Fmove.
