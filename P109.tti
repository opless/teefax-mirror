OL,5, Rachel Reeves often spent school

OL,7, Northamptonshire town of Kettering.    
OL,9,FShe'd be taken to do the rounds of     
OL,10,Fother relatives, who would press the   
OL,11,Fodd 20p piece into her and her sister  
OL,12,FEllie's palms for holiday treats. At   
OL,13,Fthe end of their week, they were taken 
OL,14,Fto the local toy shop to choose their
