OL,5, Toy giant Lego has scrapped plans to   
OL,6, make its bricks from recycled bottles, 
OL,7, in a blow to its efforts to cut carbon 
OL,8, emissions.                             
OL,10,FThe company said in 2021 that it aimed 
OL,11,Fto produce bricks not containing crude 
OL,12,Foil within two years.                  
OL,14,FBut on Monday, it said it had found
