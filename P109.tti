OL,5, The Gulf Stream system of warm ocean   
OL,6, currents could collapse as early as    
OL,7, 2025, a scientific study has warned.   
OL,9,FThe end of the system, which drives the
OL,10,FAtlantic's currents and determines     
OL,11,Fwestern Europe's weather, would        
OL,12,Fprobably lead to lower temperatures and
OL,13,Fcatastrophic climate impacts.          
OL,15,FBut leading scientists have            
OL,16,Freservations about the study and say it
