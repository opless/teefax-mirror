OL,5, There is deep shock and a day of       
OL,6, mourning in Perm, after a gunman killed
OL,7, six people and wounded 24 others at the
OL,8, local university.                      
OL,10,FThe attacker was a first-year student, 
OL,11,Fnamed locally as Timur Bekmansurov, 18,
OL,12,Fand most of his victims were fellow

OL,15,FAt the university they instinctively   
OL,16,Fknew how to act. Students told me they
