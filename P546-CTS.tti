OL,6, Teletext was a very significant part of
OL,7, my growing-up. We got our first        
OL,8, teletext TV in Nov 1987, to replace our
OL,9, irreparable Philips G8 Colour TV.      
OL,11, All I knew about teletext was the in-  
OL,12, vision broadcasts on BBC2. My brother  
OL,13, showed me how to interact with teletext
OL,14, through page numbers and I was wowed.  
OL,16, Later I discovered subtitles on page   
OL,17, 888. Speech-to-text amazed me. This    
OL,18, helped to improve my reading, writing, 
OL,19, spelling and grammar at school. I even 
OL,20, modelled my handwriting through        
OL,21, teletext characters.

OL,6, I have a proud memory of Oracle. I won 
OL,7, a prize on their Kids Tea Time Quiz.   
OL,8, With dad's help answering the questions
OL,9, I won a Meccano set. The prize lasted  
OL,10, a good two years, whilst their letter  
OL,11, is safely filed away 30 years later.   
OL,13, My party trick was knowing all the page
OL,14, by heart, as quizzed intensively by my 
OL,15, brother's mates (I thought I wasCjust  
OL,16, clever), I even knew the test pages.   
OL,18, Televox is another story. Dad never    
OL,19, worked out why his phone bill once was 
OL,20, suddendly expensive and to this day    
OL,21, he still doesn't know (is it time?)

OL,6, I remember when Ceefax opened all six  
OL,7, magazines in Nov 1989. It had Breakfast
OL,8, Daytime and Evening editions. In the   
OL,9, previous month, C4 subtitled aCwhole   
OL,10,Cday'sGprogramming, which was novel. I  
OL,11, convinced mum I had a belly ache and   
OL,12, stayed home to see it all.             
OL,14, There was talk about the IBA selling   
OL,15, off VBI lines. I thought David Mellor  
OL,16, MP wanted to close teletext, so I was  
OL,17, hoping it would never happen.          
OL,19, For an 11 year old, I did my best to   
OL,20, make sense of it all. Was only until I 
OL,21, grew up and realised what had happened.

OL,6, It became apparent that Oracle was to  
OL,7, close at midnight of 31 Dec 1992. I    
OL,8, observed the closedown process.        
OL,10, I watched Teletext UK turn on their    
OL,11, service, which took about 40 minutes to
OL,12, get it fully working. I frantically    
OL,13, checked all of their test pages until  
OL,14, their new service slowly woke up.      
OL,16, By then I turned 13. What with the     
OL,17, London TV switchover to Carlton and    
OL,18, a new era for Teletext, this was a     
OL,19, milestone for me to move on into my    
OL,20, teenage years.

OL,6, Oracle really was a means for me to    
OL,7, connect with the outside world and     
OL,8, access a wealth of information.        
OL,9, I was interested in horoscopes, TV     
OL,10, listings, news and weather, articles   
OL,11, for the young and what's at the cinema.
OL,13, Speaking for my childhood, Oracle was a
OL,14, reader-friendly service. With its own  
OL,15, soul, I was sad to watch it closedown. 
OL,16, It signified the start of my teenage   
OL,17, years.                                 
OL,19, Teefax and the VBIT has ticked an item 
OL,20, on my bucket list.
