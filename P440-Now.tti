OL,11,FIn an age of instant playlists and     
OL,12,FSpotify, you might think the           
OL,13,Fcompilation album dead, but they're    
OL,14,Fresilient things - cropping up in      
OL,15,Fsupermarkets, petrol stations and even 
OL,16,Frecord shops. Why not, then, strike a  
OL,17,Fblow for curation and look at the      
OL,18,Fgrandaddy of them all? NOW compilations
OL,19,Fstill pack a cultural punch, out-

OL,21,FSo what about the art of creating them?

OL,5,CSO YOU'RE REVIEWING... THEELASTCTRACK? 
OL,6,FThat's it. See, it's not difficult to  
OL,7,Fstart a compilation. You need something
OL,8,Fbig, bombastic, ideally a recent Number
OL,9,F1. Probably Queen, to be honest. But   
OL,10,Ffinishing it? Hmm. Do you go for a pop 
OL,11,Fgem? Opt for classic rock? Or maybe,   
OL,12,Fgiven there's nothing to lose at this  
OL,13,Fstage, an experimental or novelty hit? 
OL,14,FAs we'll see, NOW goes for them all in 
OL,15,Fturn, which makes the last tracks on   
OL,16,Fthe albums far more fascinating and    
OL,17,Fvaried than the first ones.            
OL,18,F                                       
OL,19,FSo let's skip to the end and see what  
OL,20,FNOW has to offer the diligent. Hold on 
OL,21,Fto your headphones...
