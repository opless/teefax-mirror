OL,5, Scientists have found a naturally      
OL,6, occurring strain of bacteria which can 
OL,7, help stop the transmission of malaria  
OL,8, from mosquitoes to humans.             
OL,10,FThey found it by chance, after a colony
OL,11,Fof mosquitoes in one experiment did not
OL,12,Fdevelop the malaria parasite.          
OL,14,FThe researchers say the bacteria could 
OL,15,Fbe a new tool for fighting one of the  
OL,16,Fworld's oldest diseases, which kills   
OL,17,F600,000 people every year.             
OL,19,FTrials assessing its safety in the real
OL,20,Fworld are now taking place.
