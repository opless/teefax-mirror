OL,5, Why does this matter? Yesterday the    
OL,6, prosecutors showed a series of cheques 
OL,7, to Michael Cohen, reimbursing him for  
OL,8, the hush money payment to Stormy       
OL,9, Daniels, that bore Trump's trademark   
OL,10, Sharpie signature.                     
OL,12,FCohen filed his invoices as "legal     
OL,13,Fexpenses", which wasn't true.          
OL,15,FProsecutors need to prove that Trump   
OL,16,Fknew what those payments to Cohen were 
OL,17,Ftruly for when he was signing the      
OL,18,Fcheques, so they may be using this     
OL,19,Ftestimony to show he cared about the   
OL,20,Fdetails of such transactions.
