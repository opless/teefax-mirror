OL,5, The Philippines has requested that a   
OL,6, controversial map in the new Barbie    
OL,7, movie be blurred, but it will allow the
OL,8, film to be screened.                   
OL,10,FThe production was banned in Vietnam   
OL,11,Ffor allegedly showing the nine-dash    
OL,12,Fline on a map.                         
OL,14,FThe line is significant as it is used  
OL,15,Fby China to assert its internationally 
OL,16,Frejected claims in the South China Sea.
OL,18,FBut Philippines censors said they were 
OL,19,Fconvinced the map was just             
OL,20,F"cartoonish".
