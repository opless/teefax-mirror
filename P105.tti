OL,5, A major breakthrough has been announced
OL,6, by US scientists in the race to        
OL,7, recreate nuclear fusion.               
OL,9,FPhysicists have pursued the technology 
OL,10,Ffor decades as it promises a potential 
OL,11,Fsource of near-limitless clean energy. 
OL,13,FOn Tuesday researchers confirmed they  
OL,14,Fhave overcome a major barrier -        
OL,15,Fproducing more energy from a fusion    
OL,16,Fexperiment than was put in.            
OL,18,FBut experts say there is still some way
OL,19,Fto go before fusion powers homes.
