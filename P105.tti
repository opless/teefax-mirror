OL,5, China has sharply criticised the US for
OL,6, vetoing a UN Security Council          
OL,7, resolution demanding an immediate      
OL,8, ceasefire in Gaza.                     
OL,10,FBeijing said the move sent the "wrong  
OL,11,Fmessage" and effectively gave a "green 
OL,12,Flight to the continued slaughter".     
OL,14,FThe White House said the               
OL,15,FAlgerian-proposed resolution would     
OL,16,F"jeopardise" talks to end the war.     
OL,18,FThe US has proposed its own temporary  
OL,19,Fceasefire resolution, which also warned
OL,20,FIsrael not to invade the city of Rafah.
