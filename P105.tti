OL,5, Since the Israeli military issued the  
OL,6, first of several instructions for      
OL,7, civilians to evacuate north Gaza,      
OL,8, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have   
OL,9, moved to the south of the strip. But   
OL,10, the south has continued to come under  
OL,11, Israeli bombardment, leading the UN and
OL,12, other aid organisations to warn that   
OL,13, nowhere in Gaza is safe for civilians. 
OL,16,FSome of these warnings were accompanied
OL,17,Fby maps with arrows pointing to vaguely
OL,18,Fdefined areas to move towards. Three   
OL,19,Fstrikes we examined hit within, or     
OL,20,Fclose to, those areas in the days after
OL,21,Fthe warnings were issued.
