OL,5, President Joe Biden has said a federal 
OL,6, law would be the "fastest way" to      
OL,7, restore abortion rights as he signed an
OL,8, order to safeguard abortion access.    
OL,10,FHe called a recent Supreme Court       
OL,11,Fabortion ruling, which ended the       
OL,12,Fnationwide right to the procedure, "an 
OL,13,Fexercise in raw political power".      
OL,15,FIt paved the way for individual US     
OL,16,Fstates to decide if and how to allow   
OL,17,Fabortions.                             
OL,19,FMr Biden has faced pressure to respond 
OL,20,Fto the ruling with bolder action.
