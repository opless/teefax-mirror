OL,4,CQueen and Royal Family alone but for
OL,5,Cthe gaze of the world
OL,6, This was nothing like the grand funeral
OL,7, that had long been planned. In normal
OL,8, times there would have been hundreds of
OL,9, guests from around the world joining
OL,10, the Queen and the royal family in
OL,11, mourning the Duke of Edinburgh. But

OL,14, of it was more in keeping with his
OL,15, character.
OL,17,FOne aspect of this extraordinary event
OL,18,Fwas unchanged, however, for this was a
OL,19,Ffamily that knows the eyes of the world

OL,21,Fprivate sorrows alike.
