OL,5, The number of second homes in a popular
OL,6, tourist area has fallen, thanks in part
OL,7, to a new tax designed to discourage    
OL,8, holiday properties, a council has said.
OL,10,FGwynedd had 4,720 second homes, down   
OL,11,Ffrom 5,098 last year.                  
OL,13,FThe council brought in a 100% council  
OL,14,Ftax premium on second homes amid claims
OL,15,Fpeople were being priced out of their  
OL,16,Flocal communities.                     
OL,18,FIt said the policy was "acting as a    
OL,19,Fdisincentive to owning or buying a     
OL,20,Fsecond home in the area".
