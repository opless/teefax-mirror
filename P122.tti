OL,5, A boat sent by the government of       
OL,6, Mauritius has arrived in the disputed  
OL,7, Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean,
OL,8, after the country accused the occupying
OL,9, British authorities of "crimes against 
OL,10, humanity". The United Nations' highest 
OL,11, court has ruled that Britain's         
OL,12, occupation of the islands is illegal,  
OL,13, but Britain has refused to hand control
OL,14, to Mauritius. Our Africa correspondent 
OL,15, Andrew Harding reports from the        
OL,16, archipelago.
