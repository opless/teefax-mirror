OL,5, Mathew Browne travelled to Iceland to  
OL,6, see the Northern Lights - but it is his
OL,7, picture taken 10 minutes from his west 
OL,8, Wales home that has won him an award.  
OL,10,FHe was so frustrated with his poor shot
OL,11,Fof the Aurora Borealis in Iceland that 
OL,12,Fhe made it his "mission" to improve.   
OL,14,FBut instead of going back there for the
OL,15,Fperfect pic, he captured it just up the
OL,16,Froad in Carmarthenshire.               
OL,18,FNow his Paxton's Tower image has been  
OL,19,Fnamed a winner in the 2023 Northern    
OL,20,FLights Photographer of the Year awards.
