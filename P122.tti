OL,5, This is not a history lesson.          
OL,7,FIt is far too soon to write the history
OL,8,Fof the past decade in Wales. All I know
OL,9,Fis that the story of Wales has changed 
OL,10,Fsignificantly in that time, and we are 
OL,11,Fstill trying to make sense of who we   
OL,12,Fare and where we are going.            
OL,14,FI am struck by the terms and quality of
OL,15,Fthe debate about our future. We argue  
OL,16,Fabout things which should not even be  
OL,17,Fmatters of debate. We tend to avoid    
OL,18,Fthings which really do deserve         
OL,19,Fattention.
