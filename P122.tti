OL,5, The US Army has given a birthday cake

OL,7, that American soldiers stole from her  
OL,8, as it cooled by a window 77 years ago. 
OL,10,FMeri Mion - who turns 90 on Friday -   
OL,11,Fwas 13 when her village of San Pietro, 
OL,12,Fnear Vicenza, saw fighting between US  
OL,13,Ftroops and German soldiers.            
OL,15,FHer mother made her a birthday cake,   
OL,16,Fbut it was taken by the opportunistic -
