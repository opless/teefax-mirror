OL,5, Mauritius' highest court has           
OL,6, decriminalised gay sex, saying the ban 
OL,7, reflected colonial-era, rather than    
OL,8, indigenous values.                     
OL,10,FBritish colonialists first criminalised
OL,11,F"sodomy" in 1898, but the law has not  
OL,12,Fbeen enforced in recent years.         
OL,14,FThe gay man who brought the case said  
OL,15,Fhe was "now free to love whoever I want
OL,16,Fto without fear".                      
OL,18,FThe ruling comes at a time of rising   
OL,19,Fhomophobia and tougher anti-gay laws in
OL,20,Fsome African states.
