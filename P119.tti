OL,5, Heathrow has been told to cut passenger
OL,6, charges for airlines each year until   
OL,7, 2026 by the Civil Aviation Authority.  
OL,9,FThe regulator said the reduction in    
OL,10,Fcharges reflected the recent rebound in
OL,11,Fpassenger numbers, but would still     
OL,12,Fallow the airport to invest.           
OL,14,FBut Heathrow, which wanted the charges 
OL,15,Fraised, said the move would undermine  
OL,16,Fthe delivery of key improvements.      
OL,18,FThe charges are paid by airlines, but
