OL,6, an hour after the animals were killed, 
OL,7, in a breakthrough with the potential to
OL,8, transform medicine, say US researchers.
OL,10,FThe technique could increase the number
OL,11,Fof organs available for transplant and 
OL,12,Fbuy doctors more time to save a life.  
OL,14,FThe study also challenges assumptions  
OL,15,Fabout what happens in the moments      
OL,16,Fbetween life and death.                
OL,18,FExperts said the findings were "truly
