OL,5, Climate change is affecting the speed  
OL,6, of the Earth's rotation and could      
OL,7, impact how we keep time, a study says. 
OL,9,FAccelerating melt from Greenland and   
OL,10,FAntarctica is adding extra water to the
OL,11,Fworld's seas, redistributing mass.     
OL,13,FThat is very slightly slowing the      
OL,14,FEarth's rotation. But the planet is    
OL,15,Fstill spinning faster than it used to. 
OL,17,FThe effect is that global timekeepers  
OL,18,Fmay need to subtract a second from our 
OL,19,Fclocks later than would otherwise have 
OL,20,Fbeen the case.
