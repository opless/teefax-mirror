OL,5, The Guildford pub bomb inquest has made
OL,6, a "fatal" error by saying the 1974     
OL,7, attacks were the start of an IRA terror
OL,8, campaign, a family has claimed.        
OL,10,FThe inquest is using a finding from an 
OL,11,Finquiry in the 1990s, that the bombings
OL,12,Fwere "the first in a new wave of       
OL,13,FProvisional IRA attacks in England".   
OL,15,FCassandra Hamilton said the IRA bombed 
OL,16,FArmy sites from 1973 and the sister she
OL,17,Flost could have been protected.
