OL,5, A Virgin Media advert has been banned  
OL,6, for misleading customers into thinking 
OL,7, the firm offered faster wi-fi than its 
OL,8, rivals.                                
OL,10,FThe ad boasted it had the "fastest     
OL,11,Fwi-fi guarantee of any major provider".
OL,13,FVirgin said it found the ruling        
OL,14,F"slightly baffling", and maintained it 
OL,15,Fguaranteed a faster minimum speed than 
OL,16,Fits competitors.                       
OL,18,FBut the watchdog ruled most customers  
OL,19,Fwould understand its wi-fi was faster  
OL,20,Fthan others', which was not the case.
