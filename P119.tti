OL,5, A Chinese pair plotted to set up a     
OL,6, mini-state on the Marshall Islands in  
OL,7, the Pacific, bribing MPs and officials 
OL,8, along the way, US prosecutors say.     
OL,10,FThe man and woman tried to persuade    
OL,11,Flawmakers to set up a "Semi-Autonomous 
OL,12,FRegion" (SAR) on a remote atoll.       
OL,14,FSuch a zone would have expanded foreign
OL,15,Faccess to the Pacific nation, which was
OL,16,Fadministered by the US until 1979.
