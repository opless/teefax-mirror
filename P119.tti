OL,6, Artificial intelligence has been used
OL,7, to predict the structures of almost
OL,8, every protein made by the human body.
OL,10,FProteins are essential building blocks
OL,11,Fof living organisms; every cell we have
OL,12,Fin us is packed with them.
OL,14,FUnderstanding protein structures is
OL,15,Fcritical for advancing medicine, but
OL,16,Funtil now, only a fraction of these
OL,17,Fhave been worked out.
