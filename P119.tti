OL,5, An autistic man with "chronic" kidney  
OL,6, disease should not be forced to undergo
OL,7, dialysis, despite the "potentially     
OL,8, fatal consequence of not having it", a 
OL,9, judge has ruled.                       
OL,11,FThe 26-year-old man, who is being      
OL,12,Ftreated in Nottingham, did not "accept"
OL,13,Fhe had the disease, nor see the need   
OL,14,Ffor dialysis, the judge said.          
OL,16,FMr Justice Hayden was asked to decide  
OL,17,Fwhat moves were in his best interests. 
OL,19,FBut he said: "All I could do was tell  
OL,20,Fhim that the decision was his."
