OL,5, The owners of a card and gift shop who 
OL,6, repeatedly refused to close during     
OL,7, coronavirus lockdowns have won an      
OL,8, appeal against a #35,000 fine.         
OL,10,FAlasdair and Lydia Walker-Cox, of Grace
OL,11,FCards and Books in Droitwich, were told
OL,12,Fto pay the sum last year.              
OL,14,FThey argued the shop qualified for     
OL,15,Fexemption because it sold icing, sweets
OL,16,Fand publications. But in August, a     
OL,17,Fjudge had called this reasoning a "fig 
OL,18,Fleaf".
