OL,5, A Yorkshire farmer has killed hundreds 
OL,6, of piglets because labour shortages in 
OL,7, local abattoirs mean adult pigs are not
OL,8, being killed fast enough.              
OL,10,FThe resulting backlog means there is   
OL,11,Fless space left on farms for younger   
OL,12,Fpigs, which are cheaper and easier to  
OL,13,Fkill.                                  
OL,15,FThe farmer had been "destroyed by it", 
OL,16,Faccording to a friend.                 
OL,18,F"He had to kill perfectly healthy,     
OL,19,Fviable piglets," she told BBC News.
