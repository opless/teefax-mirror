OL,5,Cfears Argentine spies
OL,6, As football rivalries go, the one
OL,7, between Chile and Argentina is up there
OL,8, among the fiercest.
OL,10,FSo it should come as no surprise that
OL,11,Fwhen Chile's national team saw a drone
OL,12,Fhovering above a training session, it
OL,13,Fsuspected its rival of spying ahead of
OL,14,FThursday's World Cup qualifier.
OL,16,FThe team sent up its own drone which
OL,17,Fswiftly brought down the "spy-cam".
OL,19,FBut rather than being a devious
OL,20,FArgentine device, the drone turned out
OL,21,Fto be from a Chilean energy company.
