OL,8, channels. Here are some relevant test

OL,15, Some widescreen TVs stretch the text   
OL,16, to fill the screen. Normal (pillarbox) 
OL,17, is desired for artwork to appear in the
OL,18, correct aspect ratio.

OL,5,CBurn-in                                
OL,6, OLED and Plasma TVs are suspectible to 
OL,7, permanent burn-in from static images.  
OL,8, On these display types, it's worth     
OL,9, checking if this has been mitigated,   
OL,10, for example by not driving pixels at   
OL,11, full intensity or use of the pixel     
OL,12, orbiter.                               
OL,14, When reviewing OLED/Plasma sets, please
OL,15, include whether or not any burn-in     
OL,16, reduction features work when using     
OL,17, teletext.                              
OL,19, On OLEDs withARBGDBGW subpixels, red is
OL,20, the most suspectible colour. Fortunate-
OL,21, ly, red is used infrequently, but watch
OL,22, out for yellow headings and red Fastext
OL,23, links!

OL,5,CPage memory                            
OL,6, Most modern TVs can cache hundreds of  
OL,7, pages in the background, enabling fast 
OL,8, access to almost any page. Older sets  
OL,9, usually only have enough memory for the
OL,10, currently displayed page and no more,  
OL,11, meaning you have to wait for the next  
OL,12, page to be re-transmitted before you   
OL,13, can see it; purists will want this.    
OL,14, Some old sets can hold 7 or 8 pages.   
OL,15, A lower limit may apply to the number  
OL,16, of subpages that can be stored for one 
OL,17, page; P521 makes good test material.   
OL,19,CSubpage handling                       
OL,20, TEEFAX uses a lot of subpages. Ease of 
OL,21, subpage selection is important for the 
OL,22, best experience.
