OL,4,BArsenal v Leeds: Why Jermaine Beckford
OL,5,Bwants another FA Cup upset
OL,6, I grew up in London as an Arsenal fan
OL,7, but, when I joined Leeds, I immersed
OL,8, myself in the history and the culture
OL,9, of the club, and since then it has been
OL,10, hard to support another team.
OL,12,FSo there is only one side I will be
OL,13,Frooting for on Monday, and I know
OL,14,Fexactly what it will mean to the Leeds
OL,15,Ffans if they can get past the Gunners,
OL,16,Fbecause I have helped them pull off a
OL,17,Ffamous FA Cup win myself.
