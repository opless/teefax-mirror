OL,7, I hope Steve Bruce can do well at
OL,8, Newcastle. He is a friend of mine and
OL,9, if there is anyone I want to achieve
OL,10, success at the club, it is him.

OL,14,Fdefeats - 1-0 against Arsenal on the
OL,15,Fopening day and last weekend's 3-1 loss
OL,16,Fat newly promoted Norwich. Those
