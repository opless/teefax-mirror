OL,6, bid to enshrine the right to abortion  
OL,7, in the constitution, prompted largely  
OL,8, by increased restrictions elsewhere.   
OL,10,FLawmakers voted by a large majority to 
OL,11,Finclude a clause guaranteeing "the     
OL,12,Feffectiveness and equal access to the  
OL,13,Fright to end pregnancy voluntarily".   
OL,15,FLeft-wing MP Mathilde Panot, who is    
OL,16,Fbehind the change, said it was to      
OL,17,Fprotect against the "backsliding" seen
