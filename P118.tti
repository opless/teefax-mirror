OL,5, The Scottish Conservatives have called 
OL,6, for the country's Covid-19 contact     
OL,7, tracing system to be wound up.         
OL,9,FThe Tories said Test and Protect had   
OL,10,Fbeen "incredibly useful" in the early  
OL,11,Fstages of the pandemic, but had become 
OL,12,F"increasingly redundant" of late.      
OL,14,FThey want it replaced with a much      
OL,15,Fcheaper sampling system, with remaining
OL,16,Ffunds redistributed around the NHS.
