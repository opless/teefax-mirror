OL,4,CAustralia attacks sweeping EU climate
OL,5,Cplan to tax imports
OL,6, Australia, one of the world's biggest
OL,7, fossil fuel exporters, has strongly
OL,8, criticised the European Union's
OL,9, proposal to enact a carbon border tax.
OL,11,FThe measure was confirmed yesterday in
OL,12,Fthe EU's sweeping new climate plan.
OL,14,FSuch a tax would make exporters to the
OL,15,FEU pay more for goods like steel and
OL,16,Fcement, to level the playing field for
OL,17,FEuropean firms paying carbon permits.
OL,19,FBut Australia has argued that such a
OL,20,Ftariff would be "protectionist" and
OL,21,Fcould breach trade rules.
