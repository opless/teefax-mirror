OL,6, when I am covering stories, but I have 
OL,7, been crying a lot lately.              
OL,9,FBefore December, when I travelled on a 
OL,10,Freporting trip from my home in the     
OL,11,FSudanese city of Omdurman - just across
OL,12,Fthe river from the capital, Khartoum - 
OL,13,Fthe only people I would see from my    
OL,14,Fwindow were those carrying the dead    
OL,15,Fbodies of loved ones on their          
OL,16,Fshoulders.                             
OL,18,FThey were looking for a roadside space

OL,20,Fproper cemetery was too dangerous.
