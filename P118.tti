OL,5, Councils are frequently failing to use 
OL,6, their powers to tackle anti-social     
OL,7, behaviour, a watchdog has found.       
OL,9,FThe Local Government and Social Care   
OL,10,FOmbudsman cited cases including a      
OL,11,Fvictim being told a neighbour's 13-hour
OL,12,Flong party did not warrant action.     
OL,14,FThe watchdog said it upheld            
OL,15,Fthree-quarters of the cases it had     
OL,16,Finvestigated in the past year and found
OL,17,Ffault in how the council had acted.    
OL,19,FCouncils said they took a "balanced and
OL,20,Fproportionate" approach to complaints.
