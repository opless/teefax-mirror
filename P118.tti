OL,5, Kenya's President William Ruto has     
OL,6, approved controversial legislation that
OL,7, will see the biggest shake-up of the

OL,10,FHis plan revolves around promoting     
OL,11,Funiversal healthcare, and requires all 
OL,12,Fworkers to contribute 2.75% of their   
OL,13,Fsalaries towards a new health fund.    
OL,15,FThe government says it will make
