OL,5, Increased melting of West Antarctica's 
OL,6, ice shelves is "unavoidable" in the    
OL,7, coming decades, a new study has warned.
OL,9,FThese floating tongues of ice extend   
OL,10,Ffrom the main ice sheet into the ocean,
OL,11,Fand play a key role in holding back the
OL,12,Fglaciers behind.                       
OL,14,FBut as ice shelves melt, it can mean   
OL,15,Fthat the ice behind speeds up,         
OL,16,Freleasing more into the oceans.        
OL,18,FThe study's findings suggest that      
OL,19,Ffuture sea-level rise may be greater   
OL,20,Fthan previously assumed.
