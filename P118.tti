OL,5, The first case of a crocodile who made 
OL,6, herself pregnant has been identified at
OL,7, a zoo in Costa Rica.                   
OL,9,FShe produced a foetus that was 99.9%   
OL,10,Fgenetically identical to herself.      
OL,12,FThe phenomenon of so-called "virgin    
OL,13,Fbirth" has been found in species of    
OL,14,Fbirds, fish and other reptiles, but    
OL,15,Fnever before in crocodiles.            
OL,17,FThe scientists say the trait might be  
OL,18,Finherited from an evolutionary         
OL,19,Fancestor, so dinosaurs might also have 
OL,20,Fbeen capable of self-reproduction.
