OL,5, Chinese researchers have cloned the    
OL,6, first rhesus monkey, a species which is
OL,7, widely used in medical research because
OL,8, its physiology is similar to humans.   
OL,10,FThey say they could speed up drug      
OL,11,Ftesting, as genetically identical      
OL,12,Fanimals give like-for-like results,    
OL,13,Fproviding greater certainty in trials. 
OL,15,FPrevious attempts to clone a rhesus
