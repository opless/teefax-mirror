OL,19, Text display is juddery near the bottom

OL,4, JVC AV28R250 26" widescreen CRT (2002) 
OL,5,CStandard:GLevel 1.0                    
OL,6,CPage memory:G7 ` Current page, 4 colour
OL,7,              links, previous, and next.
OL,8,CText aspect ratio:GNormal              
OL,10,CWhat's good:GBookmark mode allows you  
OL,11, to set 4 non-volatile favourite page   
OL,12, numbers. "Boxed" pages (newsflash etc.)
OL,13, use aspect ratio chosen for picture    
OL,14, rather than forcing 16:9. Double width 
OL,15, characters supported.                  
OL,16,CWhat's not:GOnly a level 1 decoder on  
OL,17, presumably a fairly upmarket set given 
OL,18, that it has Dolby Surround; they had   
OL,19, their priorities wrong! The subpage    
OL,20, selector always opens on 0001 and the  
OL,21, Mix function is absent.
