OL,18, level 1.5 enhancements.                
OL,19, Text display is juddery near the bottom
OL,20, of the screen, but this might just be a
OL,21, fault on my set.

OL,11, to set 4 non-volatile favourite page   
OL,12, numbers. "Boxed" pages (newsflash etc.)
OL,13, use aspect ratio chosen for picture    
OL,14, rather than forcing 16:9. Double width 
OL,15, characters and accents supported.      
OL,16,CWhat's not:GOnly a level 1 decoder on  
OL,17, presumably a fairly upmarket set given 
OL,18, that it has Dolby Surround; they had   
OL,19, their priorities wrong! The subpage    
OL,20, selector always opens on 0001 and the  
OL,21, Mix function is absent. No support for 
OL,22, level 1.5 mosaics or TOP Text.
