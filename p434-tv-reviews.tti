OL,18, level 1.5 enhancements.                
OL,19, Text display is juddery near the bottom
OL,20, of the screen, but this might just be a

OL,4, JVC AV28R250 26" widescreen CRT (2002) 
OL,5,CStandard:GLevel 1.5 (just barely)      
OL,6,CPage memory:G7 ` Current page, 4 colour
OL,7,              links, previous, and next.
OL,8,CText aspect ratio:GNormal              
OL,10,CWhat's good:GBookmark mode allows you  
OL,11, to set 4 non-volatile favourite page   
OL,12, numbers. "Boxed" pages (newsflash etc.)
OL,13, use aspect ratio chosen for picture    
OL,14, rather than forcing 16:9. Double width 
OL,15, characters and accents supported.      
OL,16,CWhat's not:GOnly a level 1 decoder on  
OL,17, presumably a fairly upmarket set given 
OL,18, that it has Dolby Surround; they had   
OL,19, their priorities wrong! The subpage    
OL,20, selector always opens on 0001 and the  
OL,21, Mix function is absent. No support for 
OL,22, level 1.5 mosaics or TOP Text.

OL,17, between horizontal line characters,    
OL,18, slightly stretched display. Unusual    
OL,19, choice of storing favorite pages       
OL,20, rather than fasttext or next page.

OL,12, picture and 16:9 or 4:3 can be selected
OL,13, for non-boxed pages. Includes a picture
OL,14, rotation setting to compensate for the 
OL,15, effect of Earth's magnetic field on the
OL,16, picture, the effect of which is most   
OL,17, noticeable when viewing text.          
OL,18, TOP Text is supported.                 
OL,19,CWhat's not:GNo facility to select a
