OL,6, In 1923, the L&Y was absorbed into the 
OL,7, newCLondon, Midland and Scottish       
OL,8,CRailway (LMS).GLocally there was little
OL,9, immediate change, and by the late 1930s
OL,10, the original electric trains were      
OL,11, looking dated. Passengers grew         
OL,12, increasingly dissatisfied with the     
OL,13, ageing rolling stock, leading to calls 
OL,14, in local newspapers for new trains.    
OL,16, In August 1939, the first of a new     
OL,17, batch of LMS-designed electric multiple
OL,18, Units was delivered to Meols Cop works 
OL,19, for commissioning. Despite the         
OL,20, disruption caused by the outbreak of   
OL,21, war, all units were in service by 1941.

OL,8, Notably, they were equipped with       
OL,9, automatic sliding doors, controlled by 
OL,10, the guard, instead of the manually-    
OL,11, operated slamdoors which were still the
OL,12, norm elsewhere on Britain's railways.  
OL,13, Each motor car had four 230hp motors   
OL,14, supplied byCEnglish Electric.          
OL,16, The units had a top speed ofC70mph,    
OL,17, which was easily achieved on the gentle
OL,18, gradients of the Southport and Ormskirk

OL,8, London Midland region ofCBritish

OL,12, The post-war years saw a marked decline
OL,13, in the fortunes of the railway, as     
OL,14, competition from cars and other road   
OL,15, transport increased dramatically. In   
OL,16, 1963 Dr Richard Beeching published his 
OL,17, now infamous reportC"The Reshaping of  
OL,18,CBritain's Railways"Gwhich proposed the 
OL,19, closure of 6,000 miles of railway. An  
OL,20, early vicrim of the cuts was the 502-  
OL,21, operated Southport-Crossens shuttle,   
OL,22, which closed in 1964.

OL,6, From 1968, the new rail blue livery was
OL,7, applied to the trains, along with the  
OL,8, now-familiar double arrow symbol. This 
OL,9, was followed in 1971 by the appearances
OL,10, of a new brand name -CMerseyrail.GThis

OL,15, to Garston. These routes were grouped

OL,8, Shropshire.                            
OL,10, The costs of transporting 507001 to its
OL,11, new home by road were expected to be   
OL,12, considerable. So, in the summer of 2024
OL,13, we launched our Crowdfunder, which was 
OL,14, an unprecedented success, reaching its 
OL,15, #10,000 target in less than four weeks.
OL,17, On 23rd January 2025, 507001 left      
OL,18, Birkenhead North depot for the first   
OL,19, time. However, it did not go to the    
OL,20, TVLR immediately, but rather to Derby's
OL,21, Litchurch Lane works, at the invitation
OL,22, of the facility's owner,CAlstom.

OL,7, many exhibits atCThe Greatest Gathering
OL,8, - a unique special event to celebrate  
OL,9, 200 years of the modern railway.       
OL,11, The unit will eventually be moved to   
OL,12, its permanent home at the TVLR. There, 
OL,13, it will be on display and viewable to  
OL,14, the public whenever the site is open.  
OL,15, Inside, we will have information boards
OL,16, telling the story of the unit and the  
OL,17, development of the Merseyrail network. 
OL,19, The unit will be connected to a power  
OL,20, supply to keep its batteries charged   
OL,21, and operate on-board equipment such as 
OL,22, lights, compressors and doors.

OL,6, In the long-term, we are exploring     
OL,7, options for the unit to carry          
OL,8, passengers in the absence of third rail
OL,9, power. This may include modifications  
OL,10, to allow the unit to be hauled by a    
OL,11, locomotice, or the fitting of traction 
OL,12, batteries to allow the unit to move    
OL,13, independently.                         
OL,15, Whatever happens, 507001's future is   
OL,16, assured. We have an example of a train 
OL,17, which served Merseyside for 46 years,  
OL,18, conveying generations of Merseysiders
