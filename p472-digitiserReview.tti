OL,5,BThe biggest issue with Green Dog The   
OL,6,BBeached Surfer Dude isn't its flailing 
OL,7,Battempt to appear cool, but that its   
OL,8,Bflailing attempt to appear cool

OL,10,F                                       
OL,11,FThe lolling, laid-back gait of the     
OL,12,Ftitle character makes for a slow-paced 
OL,13,Fand vague platform nonsense, rendering 
OL,14,Fit hard to judge jumps and aim your

OL,5,BWithout wishing to smear Green Dog with
OL,6,Bthe faintest of praise, it at least    
OL,7,Blooks and sounds fairly nice.          
OL,9,FHowever, there are decent acoustics in
