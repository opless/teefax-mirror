OL,6,BIt was an otherwise typical night in my
OL,7,Bhouse. I was sleeping on the landing.  
OL,8,Bdreaming as always of my Future global 
OL,9,Bdomination, when the HUMAN stumbled out
OL,10,Bof its room to visit the "toilet".     
OL,11,                                        
OL,12,FIt tripped over me and fell on its face
OL,13,Fand i? I was able to laugh I would have
OL,14,Fdone so. Stupid HUMANS and their poor  
OL,15,Fnocturnal vision. Ha ha ha!            
OL,16,                                        
OL,17,BTook it a while to get up though. I    
OL,18,Bhope it's food pouch-opening abilities 
OL,19,Bare not affected. or I'll have to leave
OL,20,Bto live at the house next door. The old

OL,6,BI woke up hungry this morning. But had 
OL,7,Bthe HUMAN filled my bowl? No. So I     
OL,8,Bwent up to its door and scratched and  
OL,9,Bmewled until it appeared. muttering    
OL,10,Bsomething about it being "only 6am".   
OL,11,                                        
OL,12,FTo ensure its compliance. I circled its
OL,13,Ffeet until the food was in. I presume  
OL,14,Fthe talk of my "starvation act" being  
OL,15,Fmore convincing" if I was "less fat"   
OL,16,Fwas meant to be insulting. I care not. 
OL,17,                                        
OL,18,BI took one mouthful and realised it was
OL,19,Bchicken flavour and not tuna, so I     
OL,20,Bshowed my displeasure by walking ofF.  
OL,21,BNot seen the HUMAN since. wonder why?

OL,6,BThe HUMAN was late up today. And by    
OL,7,Blate, I mean VERY late. I only saw it  
OL,8,Bwhen it was running to the toilet and  
OL,9,Bvomiting. I cannot see the point in it.
OL,10,Bwhy not Just do it on the floor?

OL,12,FEventually, after much mewling and     
OL,13,Fscratching. it went downstairs to feed 
OL,14,Fme. It retched as it pushed the food   
OL,15,Ffrom the pouch. What a selfish wimp.   
OL,16,                                        
OL,17,BI'm now sat here watching it. HUMAN,   
OL,18,BI will forgive this lapse JUST THIS

OL,20,BI will be through that catflap and down

OL,6,BI have taken note of recent events and

OL,8,Bit is not giving me the respect that I

OL,15,Ffinish it off. I chewed and scratched  
OL,16,Fit a bit. solely for appearances sake. 
OL,17,                                        
OL,18,BI went upstairs and dumped the mouse in

OL,6,BToday, the HUMAN had a large thing     
OL,7,Bdelivered to the house. I of course am 
OL,8,Bnot interested in these things, but it 
OL,9,Bdid have a large box which I promptly  
OL,10,Bgot inside. Only then did I realise    
OL,11,Bthat I could not get out.              
OL,12,                                        
OL,13,FI mewled at the HUMAN, but it Just got 
OL,14,Fup and started taking photos of my sad

OL,16,Fadversely commenting on my intelligence
OL,17,                                        
OL,18,BI later found it looking at pictures of

OL,7,Byesterday, getting only 22% hours sleep
OL,8,Bdue having to watch another cat which  
OL,9,Bwas sat across the road, I decided that
OL,10,BI needed extra comfort today. I settled
OL,11,Bdown to sleep on the HUMAN'S coat.     
OL,12,                                        
OL,13,FThe HUMAN wanted to go out, but I was  
OL,14,Fnot going to move. HUMANS are wimos for
OL,15,Fneeding extra warmth and protection, I 
OL,16,Fdecided. It left the house coatless.   
OL,17,                                        
OL,18,BHow I laughed when it started raining. 
OL,19,BThe HUMAN was soaked to the skin when  
OL,20,Bit came back. But fair's fair. I needed
OL,21,Bthat coat MUCH more than the HUMAN did.

OL,12,                                        
OL,13,FI contemplated going next door and
