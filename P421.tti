OL,17,Fprofessed relationships with men and

OL,7,FVictims, though, doesn't sugar-coat its

OL,11,FSo it's powerful melodically, and the  
OL,12,Flyrics? Ah... not so much. They're     
OL,13,Foddly throwaway, George sings of 'those
OL,14,Fthings' repeatedly, and it's as if the 
OL,15,Fband had 'Finish words to Victims' on a
OL,16,Fto-do list but didn't quite manage to

OL,18,FClub's strength in verbal, as well as
