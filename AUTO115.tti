OL,4,CClimate change: Jet fuel from waste
OL,5,C'dramatically lowers' emissions
OL,6, A new approach to making jet fuel from
OL,7, food waste has the potential to
OL,8, massively reduce carbon emissions from
OL,9, flying, scientists say.
OL,11,FCurrently, most of the food scraps that
OL,12,Fare used for energy around the world
OL,13,Fare converted into methane gas.
OL,15,FBut researchers in the US have found a
OL,16,Fway of turning this waste into a type
OL,17,Fof paraffin that works in jet engines.
OL,19,FThe authors of the new study say the
OL,20,Ffuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by
OL,21,F165% compared to fossil energy.
