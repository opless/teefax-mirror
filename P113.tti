OL,5,Cnuclear fusion goal
OL,6, A US science institute is on the verge
OL,7, of achieving a longstanding goal in
OL,8, nuclear fusion research.
OL,10,FThe National Ignition Facility uses a
OL,11,Fpowerful laser to heat and compress
OL,12,Fhydrogen fuel, initiating fusion.
OL,14,FAn experiment suggests the goal of
OL,15,F"ignition", where the energy released
OL,16,Fby fusion exceeds that delivered by the
OL,17,Flaser, is now within touching distance.
OL,19,FHarnessing fusion, the process that
OL,20,Fpowers the Sun, could provide a
OL,21,Flimitless, clean energy source.
