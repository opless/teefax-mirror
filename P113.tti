OL,5, The Kremlin has reacted furiously after
OL,6, a Polish government body advised using 
OL,7, a different name for Russia's exclave  
OL,8, of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea coast.
OL,10,FThe Polish committee said the city and 
OL,11,Fwider area should instead be called    
OL,12,FKrolewiec.                             
OL,14,FThis was the area's traditional name,  
OL,15,Fit said, and the decision no longer to 
OL,16,Fuse an "imposed name" was partly a     
OL,17,Fresult of Russia invading Ukraine.     
OL,19,FRussia said the decision was "bordering
OL,20,Fon madness" and "a hostile act".
