OL,5, Nauru has severed diplomatic ties with 
OL,6, Taiwan in favour of China, just days   
OL,7, after Taiwanese voters elected a new   
OL,8, president.                             
OL,10,FNauru's government said it would "no   
OL,11,Flonger recognise (Taiwan) as a separate
OL,12,Fcountry but rather as an inalienable   
OL,13,Fpart of China's territory".            
OL,15,FChina has over the past years been     
OL,16,Fpoaching Taiwan's diplomatic allies.   
OL,18,FTaiwan called the timing of the move   
OL,19,F"China's retaliation against our       
OL,20,Fdemocratic elections".
