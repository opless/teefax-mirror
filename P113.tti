OL,5, Elon Musk didn't actually tweet about  
OL,6, his new stake in Twitter, which for an 
OL,7, avid tweeter seemed somewhat ironic.   
OL,9,FMaybe it was because the 9.2% he now   
OL,10,Fowns is described as a passive stake,  
OL,11,Falthough those who know Musk do not    
OL,12,Fexpect it to stay that way for long.   
OL,14,FHis first move was to launch a poll -  
OL,15,Fasking whether people want an edit     
OL,16,Fbutton, something long called for and  
OL,17,Fperhaps something he personally needs. 
OL,19,FThe new announcement that he will join 
OL,20,FTwitter's board comes as no surprise.
