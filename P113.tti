OL,4,CSecrets of tiny diving mammals revealed
OL,5, Biologists have uncovered the genetic
OL,6, secrets of the world's smallest diving
OL,7, mammals - water shrews.
OL,9,FUsing DNA samples to construct an
OL,10,Fevolutionary tree, scientists revealed
OL,11,Fthat diving behaviour evolved five
OL,12,Fdistinct times in this group of
OL,13,Finsect-eating mammals.
OL,15,FThe ability of these tiny, warm-blooded
OL,16,Fanimals to dive and hunt in freezing
OL,17,Fwater seems to defy evolutionary logic.
OL,19,FThe findings are published in the
