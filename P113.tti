OL,6, have dismissed a journalist's          
OL,7, suggestion that they arranged a meeting
OL,8, because they are "similar in age".     
OL,10,FAt a press conference in Auckland,

OL,12,FJacinda Ardern said they met because   
OL,13,Fthey are prime ministers, not because  
OL,14,Fthey are both young, female leaders.
