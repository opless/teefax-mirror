OL,5, Not long after the Russians announced  
OL,6, they would be pulling out of Kherson, a
OL,7, text popped up on my phone.            
OL,9,FIt was from a resident of the city, who
OL,10,Fwanted to remain anonymous, giving me  
OL,11,Fher impressions of what was happening. 
OL,13,F"I've seen the announcement and I'm    
OL,14,Freally surprised," she wrote.          
OL,16,F"Of course, I hope things are going to 
OL,17,Fget better, but during these eight     
OL,18,Fmonths of occupation I learnt not to
