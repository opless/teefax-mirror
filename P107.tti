OL,5, Let me begin with an admission. So many
OL,6, times, I've thought: "Putin would never
OL,7, do this." Then he goes and does it.    
OL,9,F"He'd never annex Crimea, surely?" He  
OL,10,Fdid.                                   
OL,12,F"He'd never start a war in the Donbas."
OL,13,FHe did.                                
OL,15,F"He'd never launch a full-scale        
OL,16,Finvasion of Ukraine." He has.          
OL,18,FI've concluded that the phrase "would  
OL,19,Fnever do" doesn't apply to Vladimir    
OL,20,FPutin.
