OL,5, As the port city of Mariupol was being 
OL,6, razed to rubble by Russian bombs,

OL,10, building. Last Wednesday, a bomb hit   
OL,11, and - within seconds - the building had
OL,12, been split in two and left in ruins. We
OL,13, still don't know how many died, but the
OL,14, BBC has spoken to survivors who

OL,16, happened when the bomb fell.
