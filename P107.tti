OL,5, P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite   
OL,6, has admitted to MPs that a decision to 
OL,7, sack 800 workers last week without     
OL,8, notice broke the law.                  
OL,10,FHe said there was "absolutely no doubt"
OL,11,Fthat under UK employment law the firm  
OL,12,Fwas required to consult unions before  
OL,13,Fmaking the mass cuts.                  
OL,15,FHowever, he said no union would have   
OL,16,Faccepted the plan and it was easier to 
OL,17,Fcompensate workers "in full" instead.  
OL,19,FThe Conservative chair of the Transport
OL,20,FCommittee urged him to resign.
