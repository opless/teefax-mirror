OL,5, It's March 2013 and I'm interviewing   
OL,6, Mikhail Gorbachev at his Moscow think  
OL,7, tank. After half an hour the former    
OL,8, Soviet leader announces 'Vsyo!'        
OL,9, ('That's your lot!'). He gets up, but  
OL,10, appears in no hurry to say goodbye.    
OL,12,FSo, we continue to chat. Mr Gorbachev  
OL,13,Fhas just published the latest volume of
OL,14,Fhis memoirs, which he's dedicated to   
OL,15,Fhis late wife Raisa. She died of       
OL,16,Fleukaemia in 1999. They'd been married 
OL,17,Ffor nearly 46 years and from the tender
OL,18,Fway in which he talks about her it's   
OL,19,Fclear that Gorbachev misses her deeply.
