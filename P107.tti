OL,5, After six days of fierce fighting that 
OL,6, have brought normal life to a halt in  
OL,7, Sudan's capital, Khartoum, I have left 
OL,8, my house for the first time.           
OL,10,FAlthough I can still hear explosions   
OL,11,Fand gunfire across the city, I had no  
OL,12,Fchoice.                                
OL,14,FWe have run out of water. So I have    
OL,15,Fdriven to the River Nile.              
OL,17,FAt home, I have been sheltering inside 
OL,18,Fwith my wife and children. Clashes have
OL,19,Fbeen happening near my house. When we  
OL,20,Fhear shelling we hide under the        
OL,21,Ffurniture to try and protect ourselves.
