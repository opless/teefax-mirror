OL,6, A Canadian citizen has lost his appeal
OL,7, against a death sentence in China for
OL,8, drug smuggling.
OL,10,FThe court said it upheld Robert Lloyd
OL,11,FSchellenberg's sentence because
OL,12,Fevidence against him was "sufficient".
OL,14,FSchellenberg was initially sentenced to
OL,15,F15 years in jail, but in 2019 an appeal
OL,16,Fcourt said this was too lenient,
OL,17,Fleading to a retrial and a death
OL,18,Fsentence.
OL,20,FThe verdict comes as relations between
OL,21,FCanada and China remain fraught.
