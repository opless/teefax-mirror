OL,5, President Joe Biden has said the US    
OL,6, should ban assault-style weapons and   
OL,7, high-capacity magazines to tackle the  
OL,8, "carnage" of gun violence.             
OL,10,FAddressing the nation after a spate of 
OL,11,Fmass shootings, Mr Biden said too many 
OL,12,Fplaces had become "killing fields".    
OL,14,FHe said if a ban was not possible the  
OL,15,Fage limit for buying such weapons      
OL,16,Fshould at least go up from 18 to 21.

OL,19,FRepublicans and Democrats in Congress  
OL,20,Fmeans progress is seen as unlikely.
