OL,5, I'm about to climb into the first      
OL,6, "narco-sub" known to have brought      
OL,7, cocaine from South America to Europe.  
OL,9,FIt's 20 metres (65 ft) long, carbon    
OL,10,Ffibre and - remarkably - homemade.     
OL,12,FAfter clambering on top, I lift up the 
OL,13,Fwonky manhole cover and descend into   
OL,14,Fthe hull where three men survived for  
OL,15,F27 long days and nights, as they       
OL,16,Fvoyaged across the Atlantic Ocean just 
OL,17,Funder the surface of the crashing      
OL,18,Fwaves.                                 
OL,20,FIt's cramped, claustrophobic and       
OL,21,Fincredibly primitive.
