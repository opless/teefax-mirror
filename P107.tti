OL,5, Alexandra Markevitch fled Kharkiv on   
OL,6, Sunday, as Russian shells rained down  
OL,7, on her neighbourhood and gunfire       
OL,8, rattled her city. She ran with her son 
OL,9, Pasha to the station, with only a few  
OL,10, documents, family photographs, and warm
OL,11, clothes in hand, and they made it onto 
OL,12, a train headed west. When a pressure   
OL,13, wave from a rocket strike hit the      
OL,14, train, Markevitch feared it would be   
OL,15, derailed, she said. When the train made
OL,16, it past the outskirts of the city and  
OL,17, the sounds of the blasts, she tried to 
OL,18, comfort Pasha. It was his 11th         
OL,19, birthday.
