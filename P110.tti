OL,4,CClimate change: Arctic warming linked
OL,5,Cto colder winters
OL,6, A new study shows that increases in
OL,7, extreme winter weather in parts of the
OL,8, US are linked to accelerated warming of
OL,9, the Arctic.
OL,11,FThe scientists found that heating in
OL,12,Fthe region ultimately disturbed the
OL,13,Fcircular pattern of winds known as the
OL,14,Fpolar vortex.
OL,16,FThis allowed colder winter weather to
OL,17,Fflow down to the US, notably in the
OL,18,FTexas cold wave in February.
OL,20,FThe authors say that warming will see
OL,21,Fmore cold winters in some locations.
