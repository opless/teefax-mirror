OL,5, I have always been proud of donating   
OL,6, blood. I have a relatively rare blood  
OL,7, type (B-) and recently found out my    
OL,8, blood is even more precious to the NHS,
OL,9, because it can be given to newborn     
OL,10, babies.                                
OL,12,FAt my last donation session, the donor 
OL,13,Fcarer who was about to put the needle  
OL,14,Fin my arm asked: "It must feel great   
OL,15,Fbeing a Neo?"                          
OL,18,FNeo stands for neonatal, which is the
