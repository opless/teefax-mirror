OL,5, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said
OL,6, he understands calls for a ceasefire in
OL,7, Gaza, but argued it was not the        
OL,8, "correct position" at the moment.      
OL,10,FMore than 60 Labour MPs have called for
OL,11,Fa ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his 
OL,12,Fstance of calling for a humanitarian   
OL,13,Fpause was "the only credible approach".
OL,15,FHe said a pause would allow aid to get
