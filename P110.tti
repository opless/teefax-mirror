OL,5, King Charles has done two things       
OL,6, simultaneously this week that reveal   
OL,7, much about what kind of reign he       
OL,8, aspires to. First, he has led the      
OL,9, nation in the ritualising of its sorrow
OL,10, - a sorrow that has been quietly       
OL,11, expressed and subdued but it is        
OL,12, nonetheless real. And second he has    
OL,13, signalled to us in the clearest terms  
OL,14, possible that this is a reign that will
OL,15, put the future of the Union - the      
OL,16, integrity of the United Kingdom itself 
OL,17, - at the heart of its concerns.
