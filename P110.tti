OL,5, Scientists say they have solved one of 
OL,6, the biggest paradoxes in science first 
OL,7, identified by Prof Stephen Hawking.    
OL,9,FHe highlighted that black holes behave 
OL,10,Fin a way that puts two fundamental     
OL,11,Ftheories at odds with each other.      
OL,13,FBlack holes are dead stars that have   
OL,14,Fcollapsed and have such strong gravity 
OL,15,Fthat not even light can escape.        
OL,17,FNew research claims to have resolved   
OL,18,Fthe paradox by showing that black holes
OL,19,Fhave a property which they call        
OL,20,F"quantum hair".
