OL,5, The US Supreme Court has struck down US
OL,6, President Joe Biden's proposal to wipe 
OL,7, out billions in student debt.          
OL,9,FThe 6-3 ruling effectively cancels the 
OL,10,Fplan, which would have forgiven about  
OL,11,F$10,000 (#7,800) per borrower - and up 
OL,12,Fto $20,000 in some cases.              
OL,14,FThe decision affects the loans of more 
OL,15,Fthan 40 million Americans.             
OL,17,FIt has left the US public "angry," Mr  
OL,18,FBiden said. He pledged to put in place 
OL,19,Fnew measures to reduce university debt 
OL,20,Fusing other existing laws.
