OL,5, The US Supreme Court has struck down US
OL,6, President Joe Biden's proposal to wipe 
OL,7, out billions in student debt.          
OL,9,FThe 6-3 ruling effectively cancels the 
OL,10,Fplan, which would have forgiven about  
OL,11,F$10,000 (#7,800) per borrower - and up 
OL,12,Fto $20,000 in some cases.              
OL,14,FBut the plan has been in limbo since   
OL,15,Fsome conservative states sued, arguing 
OL,16,Fthe president overstepped his          
OL,17,Fauthority. The Supreme Court agreed.   
OL,19,FThe decision affects the loans of more 
OL,20,Fthan 40 million Americans.
