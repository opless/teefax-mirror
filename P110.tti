OL,5, The government is planning to remove a 
OL,6, ban on opening new coal mines from a   
OL,7, bill that is going through Parliament. 
OL,9,FThe ban was added to the Energy Bill by
OL,10,Fpeers in the House of Lords.           
OL,12,FMinisters also plan to drop changes to 
OL,13,Fthe bill which would have enabled small
OL,14,Fcommunity energy projects to sell      
OL,15,Felectricity directly to local homes.   
OL,17,FGreen MP Caroline Lucas called the     
OL,18,Fdecision "reckless" and said the       
OL,19,Famendments should be reinstated
