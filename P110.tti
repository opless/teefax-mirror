OL,5, An A-level history textbook has been   
OL,6, withdrawn after a teacher said she was 
OL,7, "horrified" to discover an image asking
OL,8, whether the treatment of Native        
OL,9, Americans was exaggerated.             
OL,11,FThe AQA-approved book asked students to
OL,12,Fbalance "criticisms of treatment of    
OL,13,FNative Americans" with "defence" of    
OL,14,Ftheir treatment in the late 1800s.
