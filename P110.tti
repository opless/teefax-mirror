OL,5, Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case  
OL,6, was dropped by the Crown Prosecution   
OL,7, Service (CPS) because of claims she had
OL,8, an episode of a rare sleep condition   
OL,9, called "sexsomnia". As a result, the   
OL,10, CPS no longer believed they could      
OL,11, secure a conviction. But Jade          
OL,12, challenged the decision and spent      
OL,13, months reinvestigating.                
OL,15,FThe CPS now admit they were wrong not
