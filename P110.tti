OL,5, UK scientists have undertaken a huge   
OL,6, "archaeological dig" of cancer in the  
OL,7, UK, analysing the complete genetic     
OL,8, make-up - or whole genome sequence - of
OL,9, tumours from about 12,000 patients.    
OL,11,FThe team says the unprecedented amount 
OL,12,Fof data allowed them to uncover new    
OL,13,Fpatterns in the DNA of cancer - hinting
OL,14,Fat causes that are not yet understood. 
OL,16,FThey add that the genetic clues will   
OL,17,Fultimately help improve diagnosis and
