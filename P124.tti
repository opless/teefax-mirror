OL,6, testing for compensation claims made by
OL,7, ex-players suffering from dementia,    
OL,8, documents filed with a US court show.  
OL,10,FIt follows revelations that the        
OL,11,Fprevious testing system was based on a 
OL,12,Fformula that assumed black players have
OL,13,Fa lower level of cognitive function.   
OL,15,FThis "race-norming" made it harder for 
OL,16,Fblack players to prove they suffered   
OL,17,Ffrom injuries linked to their careers.
