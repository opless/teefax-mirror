OL,6,FA Kenyan minister has stirred          
OL,7,Fcontroversy after saying that Rwanda   
OL,8,Fwas an "autocracy" where "whatever the 
OL,9,Fpresident says is the law".            
OL,11,FTransport Minister Kipchumba Murkomen  
OL,12,Fsaid Kenya, unlike Rwanda, was a       
OL,13,Fdemocracy with legal processes.        
OL,15,FHe was responding to criticism that    
OL,16,Funfavourably compared Kenya's transport
OL,17,Fsystem to that of its near neighbour.  
OL,19,FRwanda, which has in the past enjoyed  
OL,20,Fgood relations with Kenya, is yet to   
OL,21,Frespond to the minister's comments.
