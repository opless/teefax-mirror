OL,5, US energy giant ExxonMobil is suing the
OL,6, European Union (EU) in a bid to stop   
OL,7, its new windfall tax on oil firms.     
OL,9,FA windfall tax is imposed on firms that
OL,10,Fbenefited from something they were not 
OL,11,Fresponsible for.                       
OL,13,FEnergy firms are getting much more     
OL,14,Fmoney for their oil and gas, partly due
OL,15,Fto supply concerns after Russia's      
OL,16,Finvasion of Ukraine.                   
OL,18,FBut Exxon has accused Brussels of
