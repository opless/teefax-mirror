OL,5, Ismael Alrij had just left his         
OL,6, six-year-old son, Mustafa, in the      
OL,7, hospital when the ground started to    
OL,8, violently shake. Watching the building 
OL,9, start to fall apart, Ismael could only 
OL,10, fear the worst.                        
OL,12,F"Then the earthquake got stronger,"    
OL,13,FIsmael tells me over a patchy WhatsApp

OL,16,Fmade from glass, started shattering.   
OL,18,F"It was like a doomsday scenario," he
