OL,5, The bank holiday weekend is nearly     
OL,6, here.And after some warmer weather over
OL,7, the last few days you might be hoping  
OL,8, for more spring warmth and             
OL,9, sunshine.Well, temperatures are        
OL,10, expected to be around or just above the
OL,11, seasonal norm and skies will sometimes 
OL,12, be blue - but that does not mean it    
OL,13, will stay completely dry. Downpours are
OL,14, likely to dampen the mood but there is 
OL,15, still uncertainty about exactly where  
OL,16, and when they will crop up because our 
OL,17, weather patterns are far from          
OL,18, straightforward at the moment.
