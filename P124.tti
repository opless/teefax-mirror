OL,4,T#######################################
OL,5, The climate activist Greta Thunberg has
OL,6, claimed the UK overstates how much it  
OL,7, has reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  
OL,9,FThe government says annual emissions   
OL,10,Fhave fallen by 44% since 1990.         
OL,12,FBut she told the BBC's Andrew Marr     
OL,13,Fprogramme: "For example the UK, one    
OL,14,Fpopular thing to say is that you have  
OL,15,Freduced your emissions by 44% since    
OL,16,F1990, and of course that sounds good...
OL,17,Fbut if you look at the actual emissions
OL,18,Fthat's not the case."                  
OL,20,FSo who is right? It all depends on what
OL,21,Fyou count as a country's emissions.
