OL,5, A few weeks ago, Khalid Qasim got some 
OL,6, news he'd been waiting 20 years for. He
OL,7, had been cleared for release from the  
OL,8, prison at Guantanamo Bay.              
OL,10,FBy that point, Qasim had been in       
OL,11,FGuantanamo nearly half his life, aged  
OL,12,F23 to 43. Like almost all the men sent 
OL,13,Fthere, he has never been charged with a
OL,14,Fcrime.                                 
OL,16,FHis release order does not mean        
OL,17,Ffreedom, yet. It is merely the starting
OL,18,Fgun on a long process of resettlement  
OL,19,Fthat, going by previous resettlements, 
OL,20,Fcould take years. Where he will be     
OL,21,Fsent, neither he nor his lawyers know.
