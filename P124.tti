OL,5, The UK is facing "a significant risk"  
OL,6, of gas shortages this winter, according
OL,7, to the industry regulator, which could 
OL,8, impact electricity supplies.           
OL,10,FOfgem said due to Russia's war with    
OL,11,FUkraine, there is a possibility the UK 
OL,12,Fcould enter a "gas supply emergency".  
OL,14,FThis would lead to supplies being cut  
OL,15,Fto power stations which use gas to     
OL,16,Fgenerate the country's electricity.    
OL,18,FIt places firms at risk of running out 
OL,19,Fof money because of huge charges they  
OL,20,Fpay if they cannot deliver electricity.
