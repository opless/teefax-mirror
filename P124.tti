OL,6, of peers in the House of Lords of      
OL,7, trying to "frustrate" his Hunting      
OL,8, Trophies Bill from becoming law.

OL,11,Ffrom bringing body parts of endangered 
OL,12,Fspecies, like tusks, to Great Britain. 
OL,14,FIt passed the House of Commons with    
OL,15,Fsupport from MPs across the parties.
