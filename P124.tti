OL,5, When the luxury liner Oceanos started  
OL,6, taking on water in rough seas during a 
OL,7, voyage around the coast of South Africa
OL,8, in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his   
OL,9, colleagues suddenly found themselves   
OL,10, responsible for everyone on board.     
OL,12,FIt was during dinner that Moss Hills   
OL,13,Fbegan to realise just how severe the   
OL,14,Fstorm was. The ship's waiters, normally
OL,15,Fcompletely adept at carrying drinks and
OL,16,Ffood without spilling anything, were   
OL,17,Fstruggling. Moss, a guitarist from

OL,19,Fliner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass
