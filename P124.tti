OL,5,CAlgeria-Morocco border closure
OL,6, In our series of letters from African
OL,7, journalists, Algerian-Canadian
OL,8, journalist Maher Mezahi questions why
OL,9, the border between Algeria and Morocco
OL,10, has been closed for so many years.
OL,12,FThe main crossing between Morocco and
OL,13,FAlgeria is called Zouj Beghal, which
OL,14,Ftranslates as "Two Donkeys".
OL,16,FLegend has it that a pair of donkeys
OL,17,Fwere harnessed to a yoke in Morocco and
OL,18,Fordered to march eastwards until they
OL,19,Feffectively traced what would end up
OL,20,Fbeing the borders that delineate
OL,21,FMorocco and Algeria.
