OL,5, Over the weekend I decided to drop Elon
OL,6, Musk an email. He'd just added a label 
OL,7, on Twitter to a BBC account saying     
OL,8, "government funded media". I thought   
OL,9, I'd send him a link to how the BBC is  
OL,10, funded - predominantly through the     
OL,11, licence fee.                           
OL,13,F"Is the Twitter label accurate?" was   
OL,14,Fthe response I got which came from Mr  
OL,15,FMusk, rather than a media team.        
OL,17,FMy editor suggested I have a bash at   
OL,18,Fasking for an interview. Why not have a
OL,19,Fgo, we thought.
