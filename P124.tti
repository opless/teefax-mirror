OL,5, A car owner has won a planning appeal  
OL,6, to keep his short driveway after       
OL,7, arguing his vehicle was small enough to
OL,8, squeeze into it.                       
OL,10,FThe newly-built parking space is just  
OL,11,F4.3m (14ft) long compared with a       
OL,12,Fregular 6m (19.6ft).Â                  
OL,14,FIt was originally refused planning     
OL,15,Fpermission by Midlothian Council       
OL,16,Fplanners who felt it would cause       
OL,17,Fvehicles to overhang onto a pavement.  
OL,19,FThe appeal was agreed after the man was
OL,20,Fasked to parallel park in the space.
