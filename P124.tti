OL,5, 31 December marked the 30th anniversary
OL,6, of the break-up of Czechoslovakia; one 
OL,7, of the few cases in history when a     
OL,8, state has been divided up without a    
OL,9, single life being lost. Today the Czech
OL,10, Republic and Slovakia enjoy a          
OL,11, harmonious, friction-free friendship - 
OL,12, tinged with a touch of regret for what 
OL,13, was once a happy marriage.
