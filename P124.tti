OL,5, When Ceini Spiller wanted to thank her 
OL,6, mum for supporting her through         
OL,7, university, she instinctively turned to
OL,8, one of the oldest traditions in Wales -
OL,9, carving a spoon to show love.          
OL,11,FThe love spoon - simply a piece of wood
OL,12,Fcarved into the shape of a spoon, often
OL,13,Fwith symbols on it - began as a way for
OL,14,Fa young man to show his sweetheart how 
OL,15,Fhe felt.                               
OL,17,FThe first documented love spoon dates  
OL,18,Fback to 1667 - and although there is a 
OL,19,Flack of written history, historians    
OL,20,Fbelieve it significantly predates this 
OL,21,Ftime.
