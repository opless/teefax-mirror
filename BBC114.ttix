OL,4,CUK election vote: What just happened?
OL,5, The UK parliament has just rejected
OL,6, Boris Johnson's bid to call a snap
OL,7, general election - for a third time -
OL,8, despite the prime minister arguing it
OL,9, would help "get Brexit done". But there
OL,10, remains a chance that the UK could have
OL,11, a pre-Christmas election.
OL,13,FSo what just happened?
OL,15,FWell - and this has an element of irony
OL,16,Fto it - the leader of the UK's
OL,17,Fgoverning Conservative Party cannot
OL,18,Fjust choose to hold an early election.
