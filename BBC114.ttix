OL,5,Ccase
OL,6, Russian investigators have refused to
OL,7, drop a murder charge against three
OL,8, sisters who killed their abusive father
OL,9, as he slept, leaving a controversial
OL,10, case in legal limbo. 
OL,12,FThe general prosecutor's office
OL,13,Fconcluded earlier this year that the
OL,14,FKhachaturyan sisters had been subjected
OL,15,Fto prolonged physical and sexual abuse.
OL,17,FThe killing should therefore be seen as
OL,18,F"necessary self-defence", it said.
