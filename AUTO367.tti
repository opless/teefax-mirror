OL,6, The Formula 1 season ended in Abu Dhabi
OL,7, on Sunday with a podium that summed up
OL,8, the season perfectly - the three
OL,9, outstanding drivers of the year were
OL,10, all on it.
OL,12,FMercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the race,
OL,13,Ffrom Red Bull's Max Verstappen and
OL,14,FFerrari's Charles Leclerc. For me - and
OL,15,FI suspect many others - they were the
OL,16,Fbest three drivers in 2019. Just not
OL,17,Fquite in that order.
