OL,6, Ajay Barman, 22, is a fading TikTok
OL,7, star in India. Not because he is past
OL,8, his prime, but because - he alleges -
OL,9, he's been "shadow banned" for uploading
OL,10, videos on Hindu-Muslim brotherhood on
OL,11, the popular video creation and sharing
OL,12, platform. 
OL,14,FShadow banning is the act of partially
OL,15,Fblocking content so it doesn't reach
OL,16,Fthe platform's entire community of
OL,17,Fusers. It will not be obvious to the
OL,18,Fuser that the creator's content is not
