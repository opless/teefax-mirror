OL,4,CBelarus on the brink: What now?
OL,5, Standing outside the giant truck-making
OL,6, factory BelAZ, it feels like the time
OL,7, of the 1917 Russian Bolshevik
OL,8, revolution.  People pass leaflets to
OL,9, workers through the metal bars of the
OL,10, factory fence.  Workers organise
OL,11, "stachkomy" -  strike committees - and
OL,12, "comrades" give passionate speeches
OL,13, inside factories calling on their
OL,14, colleagues to join a "zabastovka" - a
OL,15, strike.
