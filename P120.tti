OL,6, tyrannosaur has been revealed by       
OL,7, scientists - two baby dinosaurs.       
OL,9,FResearchers say the preservation of the
OL,10,Fanimal - and of the small, unfortunate 
OL,11,Fcreatures it ate - shines new light on 
OL,12,Fhow these predators lived.             
OL,14,FIt is "solid evidence that tyrannosaurs
OL,15,Fdrastically changed their diet as they 
OL,16,Fgrew up," said Dr Darla Zelenitsky,    
OL,17,Ffrom the University of Calgary.        
OL,19,FThe specimen is a juvenile gorgosaurus 
OL,20,F- a close cousin of the giant T. rex.
