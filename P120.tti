OL,5, Orkney is a trial area for new         
OL,6, technology that could potentially lead 
OL,7, to low-impact scallop fishing.         
OL,9,FScientists working with fishermen in a 
OL,10,Fproject in the south west of England   
OL,11,Fdiscovered the molluscs were attracted 
OL,12,Fto lights fitted to lobster pots.      
OL,14,FThe lights were used instead of fish as
OL,15,Fbait to catch lobsters and crabs.      
OL,17,FBut scallops were also found to be     
OL,18,Fdrawn to the lights and a series of new
