OL,5, President Joe Biden said the US would  
OL,6, defend Taiwan if China attacked, in an 
OL,7, apparent departure from a long-held US 
OL,8, foreign policy position.               
OL,10,FBut a White House spokesman later told 
OL,11,Fsome US media outlets that his remarks 
OL,12,Fdid not signify a change in policy.
