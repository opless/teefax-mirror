OL,5, Glasgow arts venue SWG3 has switched on
OL,6, a system that creates renewable energy 
OL,7, from the body heat on its dancefloor.  
OL,9,FDancers' heat is piped via a carrier   
OL,10,Ffluid to 200m (650ft) bore holes that  
OL,11,Fcan be charged like a thermal battery. 
OL,13,FThe energy then travels back to the    
OL,14,Fheat pumps, is upgraded to a suitable  
OL,15,Ftemperature and emitted back into SWG3.
OL,17,FThe owners say this will enable them to
OL,18,Fcompletely disconnect the venue's gas  
OL,19,Fboilers, reducing its carbon emissions 
OL,20,Fby about 70 tonnes of CO2 a year.
