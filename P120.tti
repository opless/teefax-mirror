OL,5, A group of economists has questioned UK
OL,6, assertions that a "black hole" in the  
OL,7, public finances will need to be filled 
OL,8, with austerity measures and tax rises. 
OL,10,FThe Progressive Economy Forum said the 
OL,11,F#50bn "hole" disappears entirely if the
OL,12,Fdebts are calculated differently.      
OL,14,FThe government previously used a       
OL,15,Fdifferent measure of debt, and going   
OL,16,Fback to using that would leave #14bn to
OL,17,Fspare, they said.                      
OL,19,FThe Treasury said the public finances  
OL,20,Fwould be assessed independently.
