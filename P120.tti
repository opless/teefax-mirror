OL,5, A mural known as Cardiff's "Mona Lisa" 
OL,6, has been painted over to advertise     
OL,7, McDonald's burgers.                    
OL,9,FThe artwork, in the Butetown area of   
OL,10,FCardiff, was created last spring to    
OL,11,Fpromote diversity and inclusion.       
OL,13,FMonths later it was vandalised, which  
OL,14,Fpolice investigated as a hate crime -  
OL,15,Fbut it has now gone completely.        
OL,17,FMcDonald's said it did not know about  
OL,18,Fthe mural and had "instructed the      
OL,19,Fartist to repaint his original mural   
OL,20,Fimmediately".
