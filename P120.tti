OL,5, A BBC programme wants to name an MI5   
OL,6, agent because he represents a danger to
OL,7, other women and must be publicly       
OL,8, identified to prevent future harm, the 
OL,9, High Court has heard.                  
OL,11,FThe BBC has gone to court to try and   
OL,12,Fstop an injunction against a report    
OL,13,Fthat would identify an MI5 agent.      
OL,15,FThe BBC report says the agent used his 
OL,16,Fstatus to abuse two ex-partners - and  
OL,17,Fnaming him is in the public interest.  
OL,19,FBut the government says identifying him
OL,20,Frisks his life and national security.
