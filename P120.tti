OL,5, Thousands of leaseholders who bought   
OL,6, homes from housebuilder Taylor Wimpey  
OL,7, will no longer be subjected to ground  
OL,8, rents that double every 10 years.      
OL,10,FThe change follows action by the       
OL,11,FCompetition and Markets Authority.     
OL,13,FThe builder had voluntarily given      
OL,14,Fformal commitments to remove the terms 
OL,15,Ffrom leasehold contracts and exclude   
OL,16,Fthem from new contracts, the CMA said. 
OL,18,FThe effect of these increases is that  
OL,19,Fpeople often struggle to sell or obtain
OL,20,Fa mortgage on their home.
