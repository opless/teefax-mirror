OL,5, Twitter's board has armed itself       
OL,6, against a possible hostile takeover - a
OL,7, day after billionaire Elon Musk made a 
OL,8, $43bn (#33bn) offer to buy the         
OL,9, platform.                              
OL,11,FIt has adopted what is known as a      
OL,12,F"limited-duration shareholder rights   
OL,13,Fplan," also known as a "poison pill".  
OL,15,FThe move will prevent anyone from      
OL,16,Fhaving more than a 15% stake in the    
OL,17,Fcompany.                               
OL,19,FIt does this by allowing others to buy 
OL,20,Fadditional shares at a discount.
