OL,5, An agreement expected to see US        
OL,6, President Joe Biden's son, Hunter,     
OL,7, plead guilty to tax charges and admit a
OL,8, gun offence has dramatically fallen    
OL,9, apart in court.                        
OL,11,FThe plea deal, negotiated over several 
OL,12,Fweeks, was likely to spare the younger 
OL,13,FMr Biden prison time.
