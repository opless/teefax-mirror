OL,4,CChurchill through the eyes of India
OL,5, I first learnt about Winston Churchill
OL,6, as a child. A character in an Enid
OL,7, Blyton book I was reading kept a
OL,8, picture of him on the mantelpiece in
OL,9, her home because she 'had a terrific
OL,10, admiration for this great statesman'.
OL,12,FAs I grew older, and had more
OL,13,Fconversations about India's colonial
OL,14,Fpast, I found most people in my country
OL,15,Fheld a starkly different view of the
OL,16,Fwartime British prime minister.
OL,18,FThere were conflicting opinions about
OL,19,Fcolonial rule too.
