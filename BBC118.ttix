OL,4,CWhat can Silicon Valley learn from
OL,5,Ctinned food?
OL,6, If you played a word-association game
OL,7, with the phrase "Silicon Valley", you
OL,8, would be unlikely to come up with the
OL,9, phrase "tinned food". 
OL,11,FSilicon Valley stands for cutting-edge
OL,12,Ftechnology, bold ideas that change the
OL,13,Fworld. Nobody would say the tin can was
OL,14,Fcutting-edge technology, although the
OL,15,Fmore literal-minded might make that
OL,16,Fclaim for the tin-opener.

OL,19,Frevolutionary as anything now being
