OL,4,CWhy hasnb@Yt AI changed the world yet?
OL,5, When Kursat Ceylan, who is blind, was
OL,6, trying to find his way to a hotel, he
OL,7, used an app on his phone for
OL,8, directions, but also had to hold his
OL,9, cane and pull his luggage.
OL,11,FHe ended up walking into a pole,
OL,12,Fcutting his forehead.
OL,14,FThis inspired him to develop, along
OL,15,Fwith a partner, Wewalk - a cane
OL,16,Fequipped with artificial intelligence
OL,17,F(AI), that detects objects above chest
OL,18,Flevel and pairs with apps including
OL,19,FGoogle Maps and Amazon's Alexa, so the
OL,20,Fuser can ask questions.
