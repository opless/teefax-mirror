OL,5, Teletext can be transmitted over DVB-T 
OL,6, and DVB-S. In the UK, no Teletext is   
OL,7, transmitted over DVB-T and only        
OL,8, subtitles are transmitted over DVB-S,  
OL,9, but many European channels (especially 
OL,10, German and Italian) have comprehensive 
OL,11, text services on DVB-S. Many receivers 
OL,12, output this data in the VBI so that the
OL,13, service can be viewed using the TV's   
OL,14, decoder.
