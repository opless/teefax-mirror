OL,5, Teletext can be transmitted over DVB-T 
OL,6, and DVB-S. In the UK, no Teletext is   
OL,7, transmitted over DVB-T and only        
OL,8, subtitles are transmitted over DVB-S,  
OL,9, but many European channels (especially 
OL,10, German and Italian) have comprehensive 
OL,11, text services on DVB-S. Many receivers 
OL,12, output this data in the VBI so that the
OL,13, service can be viewed using the TV's   
OL,14, decoder.                               
OL,16, RTE Aertel has now been turned off so  
OL,17, there are no longer any services except
OL,18, for subtitles at 28E.

OL,4,CTevion/Ross DVB-S 5010                 
OL,5, This has got to be the worst satellite 
OL,6, receiver ever made. It is an SD DVB-S  
OL,7, box with only a composite video output,
OL,8, and it even outputs the left channel on
OL,9, both audio channels by default and you 
OL,10, have to change it manually for every   
OL,11, single channel. This terrible box has  
OL,12, no VBI output, no built-in decoder and 
OL,13, not even any subtitles support.        
OL,15,CSky Digital boxes                      
OL,16, These have VBI output (live TV only),  
OL,17, including on HD boxes. Can add RTE via 
OL,18, 'other channels' and view Aertel but   
OL,19, obviously not the content w/o an IE sub

OL,4,CBush BFSAT01HD (Freesat)               
OL,5, This early Freesat HD box does not have
OL,6, VBI output or a built-in decoder. It   
OL,7, also runs very hot and does not output 
OL,8, RGB from either of its two SCART       
OL,9, sockets.                               
OL,11,CBush FSATHD (Freesat)                  
OL,12, This newer Freesat HD box, which is    
OL,13, probably from around 2016, outputs VBI.
OL,14, The built-in subtitles facility also   
OL,15, lets you choose between DVB subtitles  
OL,16, and teletext subtitles. It has a single
OL,17, SCART port with RGB video. The add     
OL,18, non-Freesat channels function will not 
OL,19, add channels with encrypted video, so  
OL,20, RTE Aertel cannot be viewed with this  
OL,21, box.

OL,4,CFuba/Topfield ODE713HD (Tiv`sat)       
OL,5, This HD box has VBI output, but it only
OL,6, works on the Tiv`sat channels. There is
OL,7, also a built in decoder, which works on
OL,8, all channels. How utterly bizarre. The 
OL,9, oddities don't stop there; one thing   
OL,10, that cannot be allowed to pass without 
OL,11, comment is that you can't delete any   
OL,12, channels; the delete option merely     
OL,13, hides the channels from the list. This 
OL,14, leaves gaps in the channel numbers,    
OL,15, which can only be overcome by setting  
OL,16, LCN to off, renumbering the channels   
OL,17, one-by-one, and turning LCN back on.   
OL,18, Make sure auto-scan is turned off to   
OL,19, avoid your channel list getting filled 
OL,20, with encrypted Polish channels. Other  
OL,21, than that, normal FTA features such as 
OL,22, DiSEqC and rotator support are present.

OL,5, This SD box has VBI output along with  
OL,6, a built-in decoder. Two SCARTs and RGB 
OL,7, output. Using the TV's decoder results 
OL,8, in pages with missing lines, but that  
OL,9, might just be failure of my unit.      
OL,11,CPhilex 28208ALD                        
OL,12, An impressive DVB-S2 receiver. VBI out 
OL,13, plus built-in decoder, but there's also
OL,14, a USB port which can record unencrypted
OL,15, TS files onto a USB stick complete with
OL,16, teletext data. The pages can be browsed
OL,17, if the recording is played back on the 
OL,18, device, or you can extract the data    
OL,19, with TtxFromTS or tstxtdump. The box is
OL,20, absolutely tiny with an innovative     
OL,21, detachable unit containing the IR RX   
OL,22, and channel number display. Only flaw  
OL,23, is the SD output is composite only.
