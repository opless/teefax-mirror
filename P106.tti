OL,6, tax cuts in a speech where he said that
OL,7, reducing inflation is key to boosting  
OL,8, economic growth.                       
OL,10,FMr Hunt outlined opportunities in what 
OL,11,Fhe calls "the growth sectors which will
OL,12,Fdefine this century".                  
OL,14,FBut his speech, made ahead of the      
OL,15,FBudget in March, made it clear the rate
OL,16,Fof price rises would have to fall      
OL,17,Fbefore taxes are reduced.              
OL,19,F"The best tax cut right now is a cut in
OL,20,Finflation," he said.
