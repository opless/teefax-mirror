OL,5, Let's start with some facts.           
OL,7,FBoris Johnson had to leave Downing     
OL,8,FStreet last summer because a majority  
OL,9,Fof his Conservative colleagues thought 
OL,10,Fhe was doing more harm than good.      
OL,12,FNow a committee of MPs is set to judge 
OL,13,Fhe didn't tell the truth. That         
OL,14,Fcommittee is made up mainly of Tory    
OL,15,FMPs. The former PM has faced the same  
OL,16,Fprocedure as other MPs that get into   
OL,17,Ftrouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he
OL,18,Fhas been "forced out", remember he has 
OL,19,Fchosen to quit before we even see the  
OL,20,Fblack and white of their verdict.
