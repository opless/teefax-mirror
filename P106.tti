OL,6, foreign lorry drivers to make more     
OL,7, deliveries in the UK, in a bid to      
OL,8, tackle the supply chain problems.      
OL,10,FCurrently, drivers coming from the EU  
OL,11,Fcan only make two trips to deliver     
OL,12,Fgoods each week.                       
OL,14,FBut the government wants to relax the
