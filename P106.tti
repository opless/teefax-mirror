OL,5, Relics of ancient viruses - that have  
OL,6, spent millions of years hiding inside  
OL,7, human DNA - help the body fight cancer,
OL,8, say scientists.                        
OL,10,FThe study by the Francis Crick         
OL,11,FInstitute showed the dormant remnants  
OL,12,Fof these old viruses are woken up when 
OL,13,Fcancerous cells spiral out of control. 
OL,15,FThis unintentionally helps the immune  
OL,16,Fsystem target and attack the tumour.   
OL,18,FThe team wants to harness the discovery
OL,19,Fto design vaccines that can boost      
OL,20,Fcancer treatment, or even prevent it.
