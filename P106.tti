OL,5, Back in January, Kevin McCarthy struck 
OL,6, a deal to become House Speaker that    
OL,7, gave any one member of Congress the    
OL,8, power to force a vote on whether to    
OL,9, remove him.                            
OL,11,FOn Tuesday, one Republican - Matt Gaetz
OL,12,F- did exactly that. And, with the help 
OL,13,Fof Democrats, he succeeded in kicking  
OL,14,Fhim out.

OL,17,Fheads, wondering where they go next.
