OL,9, A teletext decoder and display         
OL,10, generator implemented in VHDL for      
OL,11, FPGAs. Features HDMI output with       
OL,12, selectable resolution and refresh      
OL,13, rate, and keypad for page selection.   
OL,14, Accepts a composite video input from   
OL,15, (e.g.) a Pi or satellite receiver.     
OL,16, Also supports a limited set of level   
OL,17, 2.5 features, and the code is open-    
OL,18, source.

OL,6,MNMS In-Vision Decoder                  
OL,9, This decoder, by Nathan Dane, uses a   
OL,10, 'vintage' SAA5244 teletext IC to decode
OL,11, and display teletext from a CVBS input.
OL,13, It has native RGB outputs, but also    
OL,14, uses a CXA1645 IC to encode CVBS and   
OL,15, S-Video outputs in PAL.                
OL,17, The board is designed to be highly     
OL,18, configurable for many use-cases; it can
OL,19, be controlled from the onboard buttons,
OL,20, an IR remote, or serial commands.
