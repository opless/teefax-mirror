OL,5, A coroner has said she cannot be sure  
OL,6, how a father-of-two died after he fell 
OL,7, between two fence panels, because his  
OL,8, body was too decomposed.               
OL,10,FLee Bowman's inquest heard it took two 
OL,11,Fmonths for his body to be found because
OL,12,Fpolice assumed he was still alive and  
OL,13,F"drunk somewhere".                     
OL,15,FMr Bowman's family said they told      
OL,16,Fofficers repeatedly it was out of      
OL,17,Fcharacter for him not to contact them. 
OL,19,FNottinghamshire Police said "lessons   
OL,20,Fwill be learned" from the case.
