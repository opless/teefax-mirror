OL,5, A man has been jailed for the attempted
OL,6, murder of a woman who died five months 
OL,7, after he repeatedly stabbed her.       
OL,9,FEmma Wolfenden initially recovered from
OL,10,Fthe attack by her friend Robert        
OL,11,FTruscott, who was "obsessed" with her. 
OL,13,FShe was then unexpectedly found dead at
OL,14,Fher home in Rutland, and her cause of  
OL,15,Fdeath is still unclear.                
OL,17,FThe Crown Prosecution Service said     
OL,18,Fthere was insufficient evidence to link
OL,19,Fher death to the stabbing, so Truscott 
OL,20,Fcould not be charged with murder.
