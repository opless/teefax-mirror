OL,5, The UK economy has barely grown since  
OL,6, 2019 before the pandemic, with one     
OL,7, economist describing it as "listless". 
OL,9,FIt shrank by 0.1% in May, partly due to
OL,10,Fthe extra bank holiday for the King's  
OL,11,FCoronation, which meant there was one  
OL,12,Ffewer working day than normal.         
OL,14,FThe rising cost of living and higher   
OL,15,Finterest rates have been squeezing     
OL,16,Fhouseholds and businesses.             
OL,18,FWhen an economy shrinks, people might  
OL,19,Flose their jobs and find it harder to  
OL,20,Fget pay rises that keep up with prices.
