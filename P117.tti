OL,5, A Catholic priest in Arizona is        
OL,6, learning the hard way that "words      
OL,7, matter" after a one-word gaffe forced  
OL,8, officials to invalidate thousands of   
OL,9, baptisms he conducted over many years. 
OL,11,FChurch officials say that the priest,  
OL,12,FAndres Arango, used the word "we"      
OL,13,Finstead of "I" during baptisms.        
OL,15,FCatholics believe that only Jesus      
OL,16,FChrist has the power to baptise - not  
OL,17,Fthe wider community or the Church.     
OL,19,FMr Arango has resigned from his        
OL,20,Fposition and apologised.
