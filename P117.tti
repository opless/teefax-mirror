OL,5, Voters in Minneapolis have rejected a  
OL,6, proposal to replace the city's police  
OL,7, with a new department of public safety.
OL,9,FThe decision comes six months after a  
OL,10,Fwhite Minneapolis officer was convicted
OL,11,Fof murder for killing George Floyd.    
OL,13,FFloyd's filmed murder led to several   
OL,14,Fdays of riots in the city and calls to 
OL,15,F"defund the police".                   
OL,17,FUnlike the police, who report to the   
OL,18,Fmayor, the department of public safety 
OL,19,Fwould have been jointly overseen by the
OL,20,Fmayor and the 13-member city council.
