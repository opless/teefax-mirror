OL,5, Owners of Nissan Leaf electric cars    
OL,6, have accused the firm of "dumping its  
OL,7, pioneers" after it announced its app   
OL,8, would stop working for older vehicles. 
OL,10,FThe firm says the app - which allows   
OL,11,Fremote control of functions such as    
OL,12,Fheating - is stopping because the UK's 
OL,13,F2G network is being switched off.      
OL,15,FBut customers have reacted with anger, 
OL,16,Ftelling the BBC they did not expect it 
OL,17,Fto be withdrawn.                       
OL,19,FExperts expect the issue to affect more
OL,20,Felectric vehicles as the market grows.
