OL,4,CWhat Trump wants from global trade
OL,5, President Donald Trump's approach to
OL,6, international trade is driven to a
OL,7, large extent by his belief that the
OL,8, United States is being unfairly treated
OL,9, by other countries.
OL,11,FHis main supporting evidence is the
OL,12,Ftrade deficit - the US buys more than
OL,13,Fit sells internationally. 
OL,15,FHe has referred to the deficit as
OL,16,Flosing money. In one tweet he wrote
OL,17,Fabout losing $500bn (B#388bn) a year as
OL,18,Fa result of crazy trade with China. No
OL,19,Fmore, he promised.
