OL,5,Cas schools
OL,6, The private Islamic boarding school in
OL,7, Daura, northern Nigeria, was not
OL,8, somewhere you would want a child to
OL,9, stay for more than a few minutes, let
OL,10, alone months or years.
OL,12,FThe Koranic and Rehabilitation Centre
OL,13,Fwas one of series of institutions
OL,14,Fraided over the past month where
OL,15,Fparents have been sending troublesome
OL,16,Fchildren and young men who may be
OL,17,Faddicted to drugs or have committed
OL,18,Fpetty crimes. But the raids have
OL,19,Frevealed them to be more akin to
OL,20,F"torture houses", officials say.
