OL,14, Insurgents have attacked X-HQ. They    
OL,15, were repelled but some systems are now 
OL,16, damaged. IT have switched to the backup
OL,17, but it is a possibility that some of   
OL,18, safety protocols have been deleted.    
OL,20, The Goujon John AI is no longer obeying
OL,21, or responding to control signals. There
OL,22, is also evidence that messages are     
OL,23, being intercepted.
