OL,5,CStandard:GLevel 1.0

OL,7,CText aspect ratio:GWide                
OL,9,CWhat's good:GMost functions are present
OL,10, on the remote and correct. Very quick &
OL,11, responsive interface. Subpage selection
OL,12, shows subpage number. Stores pages with
OL,13, hex digits in page numbers in memory.  
OL,14, Crisp font at LCD native resolution.   
OL,15,CWhat's not:GMix function absent. Does  
OL,16, not display link names on TOP TEXT     
OL,17, systems, only the numbers. Often fails 
OL,18, to display the bottom few lines of the 
OL,19, page when a new subpage is received,   
OL,20, necessitating a quick change to another
OL,21, page then back (seems to only affect   
OL,22, the 800s on TEEFAX).

OL,9,CWhat's good:GAll traditional Teletext  
OL,10, functions present plus "Picture-and-   
OL,11, Picture" function. Subpage selection   
OL,12, uses left/right arrows on remote and   
OL,13, displays list of subpages in memory on 
OL,14, screen.

OL,16,CWhat's not:GPage numbers with hex      
OL,17, digits are not stored in memory, making
OL,18, Bamboozle, etc. very slow. Despite     
OL,19, this, it is not possible to cheat by   
OL,20, pressing the four Fastext keys quickly,
OL,21, but maybe that's a good thing.
