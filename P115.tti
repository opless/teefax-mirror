OL,5, The UK's competition watchdog has      
OL,6, ordered JD Sports to sell Footasylum   
OL,7, over concerns the takeover could lead  
OL,8, to a "worse deal" for customers.       
OL,10,FThe Competition and Markets Authority  
OL,11,F(CMA) found that JD Sports was the     
OL,12,Fclosest alternative for Footasylum     
OL,13,Fshoppers.                              
OL,15,FIn a statement, it said a sale was "the
OL,16,Fonly way to address its competition    
OL,17,Fconcerns and protect consumers".       
OL,19,FBut JD Sports criticised the move,     
OL,20,Fcalling the decision "inexplicable".
