OL,5, Staff at homeless charity St Mungo's   
OL,6, are to begin an indefinite strike from 
OL,7, Tuesday in a dispute over pay.         
OL,9,FAn initial month-long strike ended on  
OL,10,FMonday, but some 500 staff voted to    
OL,11,Fextend it earlier this month.          
OL,13,FTrade union Unite said the "momentous" 
OL,14,Fdecision had been taken because the    
OL,15,Fcharity had refused to improve a       
OL,16,F"pitiful" offer of a 2.25% rise.       
OL,18,FSt Mungo's has said it could not meet  
OL,19,FUnite's demands and remain "financially
OL,20,Fviable as an organisation".
