OL,7, of wishing them a merry Christmas.     
OL,9,FAskern Medical Practice sent the       
OL,10,Fmessage to people registered with the  
OL,11,FDoncaster surgery on 23 December.      
OL,13,FCarl Chegwin, whose mother also        
OL,14,Freceived the text, said he was left    
OL,15,Fupset by the out-of-the-blue message
