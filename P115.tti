OL,5, A little after midnight on 6 September,
OL,6, 2022, Musah Mustafa emerged from his   
OL,7, thatched-roof hut to relieve himself   
OL,8, and saw four cars speeding towards his 
OL,9, tiny village.                          
OL,11,FMogyigna was barely a village. With    
OL,12,Fjust a handful of family homes and two 
OL,13,Fdozen people in total, it was more like
OL,14,Fa dot in the middle of an expanse of   
OL,15,Ffarmland in northern Ghana. Cars were a

OL,17,Fnight. Musah hid behind a tree and     
OL,18,Fwatched. When he saw armed men from the
OL,19,Fcars approach the two homes, he shouted
