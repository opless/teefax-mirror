OL,5, On Thursday, trauma surgeon David Nott 
OL,6, was in London - a long way from        
OL,7, Ukraine. But that didn't stop him from 
OL,8, helping to save the leg of a man who'd 
OL,9, been caught by a blast in the          
OL,10, war-ravaged country.                   
OL,12,FOleksandr, the doctor who actually     
OL,13,Fcarried out the operation, had never   
OL,14,Fperformed the tricky procedure before. 
OL,15,FBut a little over a week previously he 
OL,16,Fhad watched Prof Nott demonstrate how  
OL,17,Fit was done inside a Ukrainian         
OL,18,Fhospital.
