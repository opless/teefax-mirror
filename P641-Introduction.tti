OL,4, 
OL,5, Hello, welcome toCSix-Forty.GMy name is
OL,6,CRobert HamptonGand these pages are     
OL,7, coming to you from my top secret lair  
OL,8, (my flat) in Liverpool.                
OL,9, 
OL,10, I suppose the real question is "why?"  
OL,11, Well, as with most contributors to     
OL,12,CTeefax,Gthe answer is "why not?"       
OL,13, 
OL,14, As a child, I was fascinated by the    
OL,15, teletext system. When the family first 
OL,16, got a teletext set, I often got shouted
OL,17, at by my parents because I would call  
OL,18, up text pages while they were trying to
OL,19, watchCCoronationCStreet.               
OL,20, 
OL,21, On rare occasions when I had the TV to 
OL,22, myself, I browsed teletext for hours.

OL,4, 
OL,5, When I got an Acorn A3010 in 1993,     
OL,6, I was excited to see that it came with 
OL,7,CMode 7Gjust like the predecessor BBC   
OL,8, Micro computers did.                   
OL,9, 
OL,10, I quickly learned how to assemble      
OL,11, teletext pages to produce colourful    
OL,12, chunky graphics.                       
OL,13, 
OL,14, I even created a teletext "service" of 
OL,15, my own, calledCFabtextG(I really liked 
OL,16, the word "fab" for some reason). It had
OL,17, news, games and feature pages, some of 
OL,18, which were written by bemused friends  
OL,19, and family members.                    
OL,20, 
OL,21, Sadly the floppy disc on which Fabtext 
OL,22, was saved is long gone.

OL,4, 
OL,5, I was a regular teletext viewer right  
OL,6, through the 90s and early 00s. Sadly we
OL,7, then upgraded to SkyDigital, which by  
OL,8, then had dropped the old-school text   
OL,9, services from most channels.           
OL,10, 
OL,11, Our house did not have a good aerial so
OL,12, I couldn't even switch back to analogue
OL,13, for my Ceefax fix.                     
OL,14, 
OL,15, The closure of Teletext Ltd in 2009,   
OL,16, and then Ceefax in 2012, triggered a   
OL,17, wave of nostalgia in me. I was thrilled
OL,18, a few years later to learn aboutCTeefax
OL,19, and the community of teletext fans.    
OL,20, 
OL,21, Thanks to Peter Kwan who has trusted me
OL,22, with edit access to the Teefax repo. :)

OL,4, 
OL,5, Sitting here now, putting together the 
OL,6, pages with some chunky graphics, takes 
OL,7, me right back to those days editing    
OL,8,CFabtext.GThe only difference is some   
OL,9, people might actually see this.        
OL,10, 
OL,11, Something I am working on is using     
OL,12, modern scripting techniques to produce 
OL,13, teletext. The blog on pageC642Gis an   
OL,14, example of this - it is generated from 
OL,15, my website automatically.              
OL,16, 
OL,17, Likewise theCSudokuGon pageC648Gwill be
OL,18, automatically generated to update the  
OL,19, puzzle on a daily basis.               
OL,20, 
OL,21, It's a fun way for me to experiment and
OL,22, sharpen my Python skills.

OL,4, 
OL,5, Please browse around and enjoy the rest
OL,6, of the pages. There are some attempts a
OL,7, at teletext art, and a tribute page to 
OL,8, Ceefax that I did way back in 2012.    
OL,9, 
OL,10, I've also taken the opportunity to go  
OL,11, on at length about some of my other    
OL,12, obsessions, including trains. I am part
OL,13, of two societies which are involved in 
OL,14, preserving old Merseyrail trains.      
OL,15, 
OL,16, If you have any comments on the pages, 
OL,17, I'd love to hear from you. The easiest 
OL,18, way to get hold of me is on social     
OL,19, media atFhampo.bsky.socialGor via my   
OL,20, (very infrequently updated) website at 
OL,21,Fhampo.uk
