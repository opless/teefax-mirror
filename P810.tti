OL,7, The nearest hotel chains are Travelodge
OL,8, and Premier Inn, a few minutes from    
OL,9, Cheltenham Spa railway. It is likely   
OL,10, that one of these will become the hub  
OL,11, for an informal gathering on the       
OL,12, Saturday evening. Travelodge is in the 
OL,13, lead at the moment.
