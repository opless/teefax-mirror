OL,6, For two years the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby
OL,7, has been investigating the story of Sgt
OL,8, Paul Meyer, a homesick American
OL,9, mechanic who stole a plane from a US
OL,10, airbase in England in 1969, to fly home
OL,11, to his wife in Virginia. The story
OL,12, resonated with Dutch reader Theo Van
OL,13, Eijck, who says he too stole a plane
OL,14, while serving in the forces. But he
