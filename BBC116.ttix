OL,4,CSaviour of the dead: Burying the bodies
OL,5,CIndia forgets
OL,6, Mohammad Shareef never got to bury his
OL,7, son. Instead, he has spent the last 27
OL,8, years burying the unclaimed sons and
OL,9, daughters of thousands of other
OL,10, families. 
OL,12,FIt took a month for police to tell Mr
OL,13,FShareef that his son had died, and even
OL,14,Fthen, they couldn't tell him where, or
OL,15,Fhow.
OL,18,FMr Shareef doesn't even know where the
OL,19,F25-year-old was buried.
