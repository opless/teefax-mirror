OL,4,CTom and Jerry: 80 years of cat v mouse
OL,5, A cartoon cat, sick of the annoying
OL,6, mouse living in his home, devises a
OL,7, plot to take him out with a trap loaded
OL,8, with cheese. The mouse, wise to his
OL,9, plan, safely removes the snack and
OL,10, saunters away with a full belly.

OL,13,Fnext. The story ends as it almost
OL,14,Falways does: with the cat yelling out
