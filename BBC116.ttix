OL,6, In early January, authorities in the
OL,7, Chinese city of Wuhan were trying to
OL,8, keep news of a new coronavirus under

OL,10, fellow medics about the outbreak,
OL,11, police paid him a visit and told him to
OL,12, stop. A month later he has been hailed
OL,13, as a hero, after he posted his story
OL,14, from a hospital bed.
