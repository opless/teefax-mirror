OL,6, revolutionary Thomas Sankara has been  
OL,7, reburied in the capital by the military
OL,8, junta - despite his widow and children 
OL,9, boycotting the funeral.                
OL,11,FSankara was laid to rest at the spot   
OL,12,Fwhere he was assassinated in 1987.     
OL,14,FHis immediate family wanted the        
OL,15,Freburial at a site that would "appease 
OL,16,Fhearts", not at the "crime scene".     
OL,18,FThe dispute is seen as unfortunate, as
