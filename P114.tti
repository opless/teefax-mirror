OL,5, It is the silence that strikes you     
OL,6, first. Standing in the Simonside hills 
OL,7, area of the Rothbury estate in         
OL,8, Northumberland, there is bracken       
OL,9, underfoot and open countryside as far  
OL,10, as the eye can see. A few sheep dot the
OL,11, horizon, without fences to keep them   
OL,12, in. Hefted flocks have learned the     
OL,13, landscape without the need for         
OL,14, shepherding, their knowledge of good   
OL,15, grazing passed down through            
OL,16, generations, from ewe to lamb.
