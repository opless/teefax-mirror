OL,5, US basketball player Brittney Griner   
OL,6, has reportedly been sent to a Russian  
OL,7, penal colony in a remote region        
OL,8, south-east of Moscow to serve a        
OL,9, nine-year jail term for illegal drug   
OL,10, possession. She joins tens of thousands
OL,11, of Russian women behind bars - and     
OL,12, no-one knows how much of it she will   
OL,13, serve, as the US is keen to organise a 
OL,14, prisoner-swap to release her.          
OL,16,FUntil that happens, her life inside a  
OL,17,FRussian jail will certainly not be     
OL,18,Feasy, and she will likely endure       
OL,19,Fconditions as regular as any other
