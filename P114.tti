OL,5, Lady Gaga does not have to pay a       
OL,6, $500,000 (#410,000) reward to a woman  
OL,7, who returned her dogs after they were  
OL,8, stolen in 2021, a US judge has ruled.  
OL,10,FJennifer McBride previously sued the   
OL,11,Fstar for the "no questions asked"      
OL,12,Freward, plus $1.5m (#1.2m) in damages. 
OL,14,FBut the judge said Ms McBride couldn't 
OL,15,Fclaim the money because her role in    
OL,16,Freturning the star's dogs had led to a 
OL,17,Fconviction of receiving stolen goods.  
OL,19,FShe argued she was just making sure the
OL,20,Ftwo bulldogs were returned safely.
