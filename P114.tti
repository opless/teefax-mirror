OL,5, Katy Perry will no longer have to pay  
OL,6, $2.8m (#2.1m) to a rapper who said she 
OL,7, stole his song on her hit Dark Horse.  
OL,9,FMarcus Gray sued Perry in 2014, saying 
OL,10,Fshe had plagiarised an eight-note riff 
OL,11,Ffrom his track Joyful Noise.           
OL,13,FA jury agreed and awarded him the $2.8m
OL,14,Fpayout, but a judge later overturned   
OL,15,Fthat verdict, saying the melody was not
OL,16,F"particularly unique or rare".         
OL,18,FUpholding that decision, an appeals    
OL,19,Fcourt said the original verdict could  
OL,20,Fhave suffocated musical creativity.
