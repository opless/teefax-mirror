OL,5, UK researchers have developed a        
OL,6, calculator to identify those at highest
OL,7, risk of severe illness from Covid      
OL,8, despite having one or two vaccines.    
OL,10,FThey say jabs provide protection       
OL,11,Fagainst serious illness and death for  
OL,12,Fmost people, but for some the risks -  
OL,13,Fwhile much lowered by jabs - remain.   
OL,15,FThis includes older people, people with
OL,16,FDown's Syndrome, and those with        
OL,17,Fweakened immune systems.
