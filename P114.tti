OL,6, sculpture in honour of the feminist Dr 
OL,7, Elsie Inglis has been paused.

OL,10,Fcommissioned a male sculptor who had   
OL,11,Fnot entered a submission to make the   
OL,12,Fstatue.                                
OL,14,FThe move caused uproar from artists on

OL,17,FTrustees said "the level of vitriol    
OL,18,Fdirected by some contributors" was     
OL,19,F"bordering on the defamatory" and have
