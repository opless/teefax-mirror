OL,5, A court in Argentina has dealt a blow  
OL,6, to the sweeping economic changes       
OL,7, introduced by the newly elected        
OL,8, president of Argentina, Javier Milei.  
OL,10,FThe court suspended labour reforms the 
OL,11,Fpresident had brought in by decree,    
OL,12,Fafter he took office last month.       
OL,14,FTrade unions had challenged the        
OL,15,Fchanges, arguing that they undermined  
OL,16,Fbasic protections for workers.         
OL,18,FMr Milei is expected to appeal against

OL,20,Fthe labour reforms.
