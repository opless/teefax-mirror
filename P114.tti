OL,5, Pope Francis has suggested he would be 
OL,6, open to having the Catholic Church     
OL,7, bless same-sex couples.                
OL,9,FResponding to a group of cardinals who 
OL,10,Fasked him for clarity on the issue, he 
OL,11,Fsaid any request for a blessing should 
OL,12,Fbe treated with "pastoral charity".    
OL,14,F"We cannot be judges who only deny,    
OL,15,Freject, and exclude," he said.         
OL,17,FHe added, however, that the Church     
OL,18,Fstill considered same-sex relationships
OL,19,F"objectively sinful" and would not     
OL,20,Frecognise same-sex marriage.
