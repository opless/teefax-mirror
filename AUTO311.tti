OL,4,BKaren Carney column: Spurs need
OL,5,Btrophies & Jose Mourinho wins them
OL,6, I will be very, very surprised if Jose
OL,7, Mourinho doesn't win a trophy with
OL,8, Tottenham.
OL,10,FSpurs need trophies and if there is
OL,11,Fsomebody available who is an absolute
OL,12,Fwinner and gets trophies wherever he
OL,13,Fgoes, then why wouldn't you get him?
OL,15,FThe results from Mauricio Pochettino
OL,16,Fwere not in his favour. He was
OL,17,Funderperforming and Spurs needed to
OL,18,Fchange. It was not a surprise really.
