OL,5, A judge in Mississippi has rejected a  
OL,6, request from the state's only abortion 
OL,7, clinic to temporarily block a ban on   
OL,8, almost all abortions.                  
OL,10,FIt means that - providing there are no 
OL,11,Ffurther legal developments - the ban   
OL,12,Fwill take effect on Thursday with the  
OL,13,Fclinic closing the day before.         
OL,15,FThe ban can come into force because the
OL,16,FSupreme Court overturned the landmark  
OL,17,FRoe v Wade ruling last month.          
OL,19,FThe 1973 decision guaranteed the       
OL,20,Fconstitutional right to an abortion.
