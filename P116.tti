OL,5, Finnish researchers have installed the 
OL,6, world's first fully working "sand      
OL,7, battery" which can store green power   
OL,8, for months at a time.                  
OL,10,FThe developers say this could solve the
OL,11,Fproblem of year-round supply, a major  
OL,12,Fissue for green energy.                
OL,14,FUsing low-grade sand, the device is    
OL,15,Fcharged up with heat made from cheap   
OL,16,Felectricity from solar or wind.        
OL,18,FThe sand stores the heat at around     
OL,19,F500C, which can then warm homes in     
OL,20,Fwinter when energy is more expensive.
