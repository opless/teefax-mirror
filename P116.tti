OL,5,Clinked to insect loss
OL,6, Scientists say light pollution may be
OL,7, contributing to "worrying" declines in
OL,8, insects seen in recent decades.
OL,10,FIn a UK study, artificial street lights
OL,11,Fwere found to disrupt the behaviour of
OL,12,Fnocturnal moths, reducing caterpillars

OL,16,Fhave the biggest impact.
OL,18,FThere is growing evidence that insect
OL,19,Fpopulations are shrinking due to the
OL,20,Flikes of climate change, habitat loss
OL,21,Fand pesticides.
