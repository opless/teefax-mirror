OL,4,CHow much should bosses be paid?
OL,5, The boss of privately-owned online
OL,6, gambling firm Bet365 Denise Coates has
OL,7, received a B#320m payday, confirming
OL,8, her position as the UK's best paid
OL,9, executive. She was paid a B#277m salary
OL,10, plus dividends, reigniting the debate
OL,11, about how much bosses should earn. 
OL,13,F"The average chief executive of a major
OL,14,FAmerican corporation - according to a
OL,15,Frecent Senate hearing - is paid about
OL,16,F100 times as much as the average
OL,17,Fworker. And our government today
OL,18,Frewards that excess with a tax break
OL,19,Ffor executive pay, no matter how high
OL,20,Fit is. That's wrong."
