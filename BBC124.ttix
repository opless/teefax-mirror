OL,6, The northern Afghan city of Kunduz is
OL,7, not the kind of place you'd expect to
OL,8, find a radio station run by women,
OL,9, promoting women's rights. But this is
OL,10, precisely what Radio Roshani is, and
OL,11, it's broadcasting today despite several
OL,12, attempts by the Taliban to kill its
OL,13, founder and editor, Sediqa Sherzai.
OL,15,FRadio Roshani broadcasts to a man's

OL,17,Ftradition has long dictated that women
OL,18,Fand girls are rarely seen or heard
