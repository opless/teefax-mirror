OL,4,CWhy bears are coming out of hibernation
OL,5,Cearly
OL,6, From Russia and Finland to Canada and
OL,7, the US, there's been multiple sightings
OL,8, of bears around the world.
OL,10,FThat might not sound too weird - but
OL,11,Fbears aren't normally spotted this
OL,12,Fearly in the year, which makes this
OL,13,Fpretty unusual. 
OL,15,FThey usually stay in hibernation -
OL,16,Fwhich is like a deep sleep that helps
OL,17,Fthem to save energy - and survive the
OL,18,Fwinter without eating much.
